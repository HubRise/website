HubRise now supports catalog variants.

Catalog variants are a way to group products that are similar but differ by one or more attributes. For example, a product can be available in different sizes, colors, or materials. Each variant is a different product, but they are related to each other.

Catalog variants are useful for:

- Inventory management: you can track the stock of each variant separately.
- Order management: you can sell a variant even if it is not available in stock, and then order it from your supplier.
- Reporting: you can analyze the sales of each variant separately.
- E-commerce: you can display each variant on your website.
- And more...

## How to use catalog variants

To use catalog variants, you need to:

1. Create a catalog.
2. Create a product.
3. Create a variant for this product.
4. Create a variant option for this variant.
5. Create a variant option value for this variant option.
