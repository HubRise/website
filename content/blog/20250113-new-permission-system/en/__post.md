Our permissions system has undergone a major update. The old system, while simple, lacked flexibility, offering just two roles with almost identical levels of access. The new system changes that, giving you granular control over what each user can see and do. Whether you're managing billing access, creating read-only roles, or integrating with a technical partner, the new system adapts to your needs.

## Fine-Tuned User Roles

The updated permissions system still works at both account and location levels, but now you can configure permissions to fit your business. Here are some examples of what's possible:  

- **Billing-only roles**: Allow a user to receive billing emails and download invoices, without accessing sensitive business data.
- **Read-only back office**: Give managers the ability to view dashboards and reports without making changes.
- **Secure technical access**: Grant technical partners access to integrations and logs while restricting billing or other private information.

This flexibility ensures that every team member or partner gets the access they need—nothing more, nothing less.

## App-Only Users

We’ve also introduced **app-only users**. These users can only access **Catalog Manager** and **OrderLine** HubRise apps. When they log in to the back office, they are redirected to a new **App Launcher** page, where they can only open their assigned apps and locations.

App-only users are perfect for team members or external collaborators who only need to interact with specific applications.

## Integration for Software Editors

For software editors looking for deeper integration, we now support **direct app access links**. This lets you embed Catalog Manager or OrderLine directly into your own back office. Your users can bypass the App Launcher entirely, making the transition between systems seamless.

## Why It Matters

The updated permissions system offers:

- **Granular control** to adapt to your specific business workflows.
- **Enhanced security** by limiting access to the minimum required.
- **A simpler experience** for app-only users and external collaborators.

These improvements are designed for businesses that want a secure, efficient, and scalable way to manage access across their team and partners.

## What's Next?

The new permissions system is available now. Simply log in to your back office to explore its capabilities.

As always, we're eager to hear your feedback. Let us know how we can continue improving HubRise to better meet your needs.
