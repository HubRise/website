Some of our partners need ready-to-use tools they can offer under their own brand. Others want to expand their product offering without diverting resources into building niche features. HubRise White Label allows selected partners to provide our solutions as their own, with their logo, domain name, and branding.

## Who is HubRise White Label for?

The HubRise White Label programme is designed for software vendors, resellers, and chains. It addresses several use cases:

- Startups that need a polished tool today but plan to build their own later. OrderLine and Catalog Manager both use our public API, so they can be used as a temporary solution while an in-house product takes shape.
- Mature software vendors who want to offer additional tools but find some features too niche to justify building themselves. White Label lets them expand their product line without draining development resources.
- Software resellers seeking additional revenue streams. Many already recommend HubRise tools to their customers—now they can integrate them directly into their offering.
- Chains that want to provide a comprehensive suite of branded tools for their franchisees or locations.

## What Can Be Branded?

With HubRise White Label, you can customise:

- [OrderLine](/apps/orderline/overview) – Order centralisation for locations
- [Catalog Manager](/apps/catalog-manager/overview) – Product catalog management
- White Label Portal – A centralised login page under your domain name

Your customers log in via your domain name, see your logo, and interact with a product that feels fully integrated into your system.
