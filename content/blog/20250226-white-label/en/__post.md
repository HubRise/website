  description: HubRise White Label allows partners to offer our solutions under their own brand, providing a seamless experience for their customers.
excerpt: With HubRise White Label, software vendors can offer HubRise suite of well-tested tools under their own brand. Whether as a stopgap or a long-term solution, it helps them expand their offering while we stay in the background.

Some of our partners need ready-to-use tools they can offer under their own brand. Others want to expand their product offering without diverting resources into building niche features. HubRise White Label allows selected partners to provide our solutions as their own, with their logo, domain, and branding.

## Who is HubRise White Label for?

HubRise White Label is designed for software vendors, resellers, and chains that want to integrate additional tools into their ecosystem. This programme was built to address the needs of:

- Startups that need a polished tool today but plan to build their own later. OrderLine and Catalog Manager both use our public API, so they can be used as a temporary solution while an in-house product takes shape.
- Mature software vendors who want to offer additional tools but find some features too niche to justify building themselves. White Label lets them expand their product line without draining development resources.
- Any partner looking for seamless integration. Many already recommend HubRise tools to their customers, but now they can make them a direct part of their product, keeping users within their own ecosystem.

## What Can Be Branded?

With HubRise White Label, you can customise:

- [OrderLine](/apps/orderline/overview) – Order management for locations
- [Catalog Manager](/apps/catalog-manager/overview) – Product catalogue management
- White Label Portal – A centralised login page under your domain

Your customers log in via your domain, see your logo, and interact with a product that feels fully integrated into your system.
