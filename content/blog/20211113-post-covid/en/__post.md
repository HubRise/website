**Forced to accelerate their digital transformation during the crisis, merchants and restaurateurs are now using an increasing number of applications. With reopening, it's essential to optimize operations to avoid multiple screens, manual entries, imports/exports, and copy/pasting. HubRise, an innovation born in Sophia-Antipolis, meets this challenge by easily connecting more than 70 third-party applications, offering merchants a digital environment and tools previously reserved for large groups.**

## Retail and Restaurant Businesses Must Adapt to a More Digitalized, Connected "Post-COVID" World

Faced with the crisis-imposed restrictions, commerce and restaurant sectors have massively turned to digital solutions in the last 12 months (online sales, click & collect, drive-through, home delivery, etc.). As a result, e-commerce now accounts for 13.4% of retail trade, up from 9.8% in 2019 (source Fevad).

This digitalization has allowed merchants to continue generating revenue during the crisis, but it also requires them to find solutions to streamline and optimize their operations. How to avoid manual entries across multiple screens, copy/pasting, or importing/exporting from one solution or file to another? HubRise, a Sophian innovation, tackles this by facilitating third-party solution integrations.

## HubRise's Vision is a World Where All Software Can Be Connected

HubRise is a middleware that simplifies technical integrations between third-party solutions by moving data to the cloud and standardizing its format.

Antoine Monnier, founder and director of HubRise, explains:

> To connect two applications - such as a cash register software with an online ordering solution - used to require "one to one" integrations, which cost developers several weeks of work and companies thousands of euros. Now, publishers only need to integrate once with HubRise to join a whole ecosystem of already connected applications.

By enabling merchants to connect third-party applications, HubRise turns complex and disparate IT and technological environments into simple and uniform ones, a privilege once reserved for large groups with IT departments.
HubRise currently connects over 70 applications and hopes to increase this to 150 within 18 months.

## An Ecosystem at a Fair and Accessible Price, Open to All Developers

Florists, tobacconists, bakeries, and restaurants are now turning to the HubRise solution. For a very accessible price of 25€ excl. VAT per month and per point of sale, these businesses benefit from facilitated integrations with all the solutions already integrated into the hub, including online ordering, loyalty and marketing, management and inventory, delivery management, and home delivery solutions.

HubRise's distinction is being an open solution. With detailed technical documentation available online, application publishers and developers can connect to its ecosystem for free. Like open-source software, this model allows HubRise to attract publishers and developers without deploying significant sales force, thus ensuring the rapid growth of its ecosystem for the benefit of its users.

## Software Integration Brings Concrete Benefits to Merchants

While HubRise works behind the scenes, it enables merchants to enjoy concrete benefits and advantages daily:

- **Operation Simplification**: all orders are centralized on a single screen, saving time and improving productivity.
- **Freedom to Choose Solutions**: merchants can easily adopt new applications (table payment, QR code table ordering, etc.) and keep up with market trends.
- **Time Savings for Managers**: end of manual imports/exports and "hand" consolidations.

These benefits ultimately translate into improved profitability. HubRise's clients include restaurant brands like 911 Pizza, Cosmo Sushi, Kajirō Sushi, as well as Pizza Hut and Papa John's to name the larger groups.

## About HubRise

HubRise simplifies technical integrations between the software solutions of restaurateurs and retailers, such as online ordering sites, cash register software, delivery management, digital loyalty cards, or smartphone payments.

The innovation brought by HubRise is to centralize data and make it accessible to third-party applications through a secure API. Like an airport hub, HubRise transfers data between solutions not directly connected, thus multiplying possible combinations. Applications connected to HubRise share real-time products, customer files, orders, and other data.

HubRise is particularly interesting for:

- **Software publishers**, who gain access to many integrations without significant development effort
- And **commerce and restaurant businesses**, who can connect their solutions and thus improve productivity, a privilege once reserved for large groups with IT departments.

HubRise is a French company, based in Sophia Antipolis (06), and supported by Telecom Paris Eurecom Entrepreneurs.
