## The Challenge: Managing Orders Across Multiple Channels

Restaurants today manage orders from multiple sources: **in-store** via waiters’ handheld devices, table-ordering apps, and kiosks, and **off-premises**, via their own websites or delivery platforms like Uber Eats and Deliveroo. Menus and product availability need to stay in real-time sync across all sales channels. Orders must be routed instantly to the EPOS, printers, or kitchen display screens, while operations management tools require complete data to calculate margins and prepare purchasing lists.

Connecting all these systems is no longer a “nice-to-have” but an operational necessity. Solutions like **Deliverect** and **HubRise** exist to help both restaurateurs and the growing ecosystem of restaurant-focused software providers, who cannot realistically integrate with every solution available out there.

## Deliverect and HubRise at a Glance

**Deliverect** connects all your in-store and off-premises sales channels with your EPOS and kitchen, centralising orders, customers, menus, inventory, and other data in one place. It also provides native tools to manage these features.
Beyond integrations, Deliverect offers its own software suite, including a Delivery Management System (DMS), Kitchen Display Screen (KDS), table-ordering apps, kiosks, an online ordering solution, and marketplace intelligence to optimise pricing.
Backed by significant funding rounds, Deliverect maintains a large sales force and invests heavily in marketing and communication—meaning many restaurateurs hear about them first.

**HubRise** offers integration capabilities comparable to those of Deliverect but positions itself as **middleware**. It does not develop a full suite of restaurant apps, but apps needed to manage menus, receive orders, update inventory, and set opening hours. For other specialised solutions such as delivery management systems or kitchen display systems, it relies on the expertise of integrated partners.
Unlike Deliverect, HubRise is entirely self-funded and HubRise focuses its resources on technology and product development. Without large-scale e-marketing and sales campaigns, HubRise may be less visible despite the fact that its technical capabilities are equally strong.

## Why Restaurants Choose HubRise

### Centralised Orders
HubRise routes orders from multiple sales channels, including delivery platforms and your own branded online ordering website or self ordering kiosks—directly to your EPOS or into OrderLine, a HubRise app, where orders can be managed, printed, and tracked. Delivery platforms can be temporarily paused during peak times to prioritise your own website and in-store orders.

### Centralised Inventory and Opening Hours
HubRise automatically syncs inventory from your EPOS or allows you to manage it manually. Update opening hours once in HubRise, and they instantly apply across connected delivery platforms and other sales channels that integrated this feature.

### Centralised Menu Management
HubRise synchronises menus from your EPOS to all connected sales channels. Menus can also be created and managed directly in HubRise. Location, or sales channel specific catalog variants, such as different prices or available items, are supported. This makes HubRise an ideal solution for chains and franchises or dark kitchens that share certain menu items (e.g., desserts or drinks) but have unique main offerings.

### Large Ecosystem of Integrated Solutions
HubRise connects with a wide range of EPOS systems, kitchen displays, cloud printers, kiosks, online ordering solutions, table-ordering apps, WhatsApp ordering, delivery platforms, marketing tools, operations management platforms, delivery management solutions, and more. Each restaurant can build its own custom ecosystem.

### Support by engineers
When you need assistance, you communicate directly with onboarding and support engineers by email or through a scheduled call or web-conference. This ensures your questions are answered by the people perfectly informed, providing clear, technical, and reliable solutions without delays or scripted chatbot responses.

### Transparent, Flat-Pricing Model
HubRise offers a simple, predictable pricing model: **€35 per location**, with no setup fees, no long-term contracts, and no per-order fees. Many customers switching from Deliverect cite cost savings as an important factor in their decision.
