**La Fée des Champs, a Parisian shop, synchronises its sales and saves precious time!**

The convergence between physical shop and online store represents a major operational challenge for many store managers. [La Fée des Champs](https://www.lafeedeschamps.fr), a small shop offering natural cosmetics and zero-waste products tucked away in the Butte aux Cailles district in Paris, overcame this challenge by relying on HubRise to synchronise its catalogue, prices, and inventory in real time between its [Kezia II EPOS by JDC](https://www.jdc.fr) and its e-commerce site [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com). A case study of a simple and effective technical integration, delivering tangible benefits: streamlined operations and satisfied customers with every order.

## About La Fée des Champs

### An eco-friendly, multichannel, and seamless journey

Founded by Nadia Dumont-Martinez, who is committed to more eco-friendly and responsible consumption, La Fée des Champs offers a selection of natural cosmetics and zero-waste products crafted by small French producers. To reach both local residents and a wider clientele, Nadia quickly adopted a multichannel strategy:

- a physical shop in the heart of the Butte aux Cailles district, in the 13th arrondissement in Paris;
- a website on Shopify, created autonomously and launched in September 2024;
- corporate exhibitions to showcase her products to new clients.

While Nadia's journey — a literature graduate who spent several years in IT before embarking on an eco-friendly venture — is inspiring, it's the technical aspect of her organisation that draws our attention: how can one effectively manage products, inventory, and prices across multiple channels without increasing the risk of manual errors?

## Before HubRise

### A Kezia II EPOS and an online shop on Shopify

Shortly after launching her e-commerce site, Nadia was confronted with the lack of integration between her Kezia II EPOS and her Shopify store. To avoid double entry of the product catalogue and centralise orders and inventory data, she sought an automated synchronisation solution.

Without this synchronisation, Nadia had to manually update prices and inventory each day, with all the risks of human errors — such as out-of-stock products appearing online and discrepancies in accounting. "It was a daily headache," she confides.

## Discovering HubRise

### HubRise, a privileged JDC integration partner, appeared as the obvious answer

"I was immediately reassured to know that JDC and HubRise work hand in hand," explains Nadia. This close relationship allowed her to take the plunge without apprehension. This proximity was a guarantee of smooth support and quick resolution of any possible incidents.

## The connection between Kezia II and Shopify via HubRise

### An assisted setup, mapping and testing

JCD introduced Nadia to HubRise so that she could benefit from personalised support in configuring the solutions to be connected. After a few exchanges, the HubRise support team explained how to create her account on HubRise, connect Shopify, refine the mapping of ref codes and verify online sales were correctly reported in the EPOS. JCD, on their side, handled the connection with Kezia II. A few weeks of tests and some adjustments, particularly on inventories, were enough to get the connection fully operational.

## Concrete results

### Synchronised sales, always up-to-date stocks

Thanks to HubRise, Nadia explains that the synchronisation between the Kezia II EPOS and the Shopify e-commerce site is now fully automated: "When an online purchase is made, it is instantly recorded in the EPOS as a classic sale, while being identified as coming from the site — a crucial point for accounting. Stocks are updated in real-time in both directions, whether the sale occurs in-store or online. Moreover, any price changes made in the EPOS are automatically reflected on the site, without any manual intervention. Similarly, when restocking in the store, inventories are immediately updated on Shopify. It was so easy, I couldn't believe it!"

## Future perspectives

While Nadia doesn't plan to connect any other solutions for now, she knows that HubRise offers the flexibility to add additional apps in the future thanks to its ecosystem of integrated apps (Mailchimp, ERP, CRM…).

"Once configured, HubRise is a tool that is simple to use," says Nadia, then she adds: "when creating a new product, only two elements need to be entered to activate the synchronisation. Just tick a box in Kezia II and provide the unique ID of the product in Shopify. This identification ensures precise matching between the two systems, avoiding any mix-up of products through a link based on this unique ID."

For any retailer or CTO looking to secure and automate the synchronisation between an EPOS and e-commerce, the connection between Kezia II by JDC and Shopify via HubRise is a proven and accessible solution, even for a small business such as La Fée des Champs. Simple to set up, cost-effective, and supported by a responsive technical support team, it helps avoid manual entry and synchronisation errors, freeing up time to focus on what matters most: growing the business.
