**Who better than our technical partners to talk to you about integration? We give the floor to Théo Vandemeulebroucke - CEO and co-founder of SOS Soirée - who has just finalised his integration with HubRise, in (almost) complete autonomy.**

Assisted by our open and public API, his computer skills, and our technical documentation, he swapped his CEO hat for that of a developer. Reflecting on his experience.\*\*

Founded in 2011 by three friends studying computer science, SOS Soirée is today a major player aperitifs and spirits delivery in Annecy and Tignes, two French urban areas.

And if this "aperitif Dark Kitchen" business quickly won over the hearts of Annecy party-goers, it wasn't just due to its innovative concept (remember that in 2011, Uber Eats and Deliveroo did not yet exist); it's also thanks to the quality of its delivery service supported by a dedicated fleet, as well as the co-founders background in computer science wisely used to create their own tools: an EPOS and an online ordering website.

Thanks to this same know-how Théo Vandemeulebroucke - the sole member of the trio to continue the adventure - has successfully integrated with HubRise, in almost total autonomy. Interview.

## What challenges did integration appear to be the ideal solution for?

Several years ago, we made the decision to work with Uber Eats and Deliveroo. Each of them provided us with a tablet on which we receive orders.

However, in recent years, we've seen a significant increase in sales, which became a real problem: for our drivers to access these orders on their smartphones, we had to manually re-enter them into our system, which is time-consuming and subject to a considerable risk of human error. The idea was to connect our EPOS to these platforms in order to centralise all orders in one single location.

We reached out to Uber Eats and Deliveroo, but neither was willing to open their APIs and interfacing tools - a service they offer only for major accounts. We, therefore, had to look for an alternative solution to establish this bridge.

## Did you compare HubRise with other solutions, and why did you ultimately choose HubRise?

During my market research, I identified two companies: Deliverect and HubRise; after speaking with both, I quickly made my choice, and not just for cost reasons. I found HubRise's approach particularly interesting: it's a French company founded by a computer scientist, which has maintained a reasonable size and enjoys the responsiveness, attentiveness and flexibility that comes with it. From the very start, I could tell that we were going to understand each other and communicate effectively and swiftly.

## How did the integration process with HubRise go, which you carried out almost entirely on your own?

It went very well! Their documentation is very well written and I needed very little interaction with the team throughout the process. I'm not saying it was simple, because you still have to transform orders from a specific format - the HubRise format - into an SOS Soirée format, but in the end, it was smooth and I encountered few obstacles.

HubRise has a well-studied and well-structured process: we can use their tools to push test orders, and before going live, we go through an audit phase, which I conducted with one of their engineers, a person who is attentive and extremely sharp.

## How much time did you spend on this integration?

Between the moment I created the first test account on HubRise and the moment was in production, a year has passed, but I did not fully dedicate myself to it! If I add up the actual time spent and reason it in day/man, I would say I spent 2 weeks on it, not counting the few back-and-forths for bug resolution. In the end, it was rather quick.

## Which applications have you connected to your system via HubRise?

For now, only Uber Eats and Deliveroo, but it's very interesting to know that thanks to this integration, we can connect with a bunch of other solutions if we want to. Finally, the fact that these two platforms did not open their API to us was a blessing in disguise, and we clearly came out on top!

## What tangible benefits does this integration with HubRise bring you?

The time saving to get started, a very concrete benefit that we were able to observe from the beginning of our integration! Before, we used to spend 2 to 3 minutes manually re-entering each order, so on an evening's work, I can tell you that we immediately fell the difference!

We have also gained in productivity: all the time saved by no longer entering orders is time we can reallocate to other more constructive and profitable tasks.

By eliminating tablets that ring every time a new order arrives, we have also gained in comfort and workspace.

I am also convinced that in the long term, our accounting will be simplified. As manual data entry inevitably leads to errors, there are sometimes discrepancies between what we invoice and what the platforms pay us at the end of the week. By removing these sources of error, we will also eliminate these discrepancies.

And in the end, it's the user who wins. All this time saved from not entering orders is time saved on preparation and therefore on delivery. Not to mention that by eliminating the risks of error, customers are certain to receive exactly what they ordered online, which improves long-term satisfaction and client retention.

## What advice would you give to those who are considering integrating with HubRise and who, like you, would consider doing this integration themselves?

Everything depends on the technical background of the person. REST APIs are quite standard in computing, so, if we already integrated this kind of thing and follow the documentation provided by HubRise, things will be fine. For those not familiar with the REST API concept, I would recommend taking a bit of time to discover this type of system and to train before you get started.

I would also advise not hesitate to contact the HubRise integration team for assistance. The team is reactive and helpful, and since it is a human-sized company, we benefit from a single contact throughout the process. It makes communication easier and simplifies a lot of things when you deal with a person who knows your project well and has been following it from the beginning!
