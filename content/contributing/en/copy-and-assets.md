Each solution integrated with HubRise is included on the [Apps Page](/apps), and a full documentation will be written, with an overview and how it connects to HubRise. This documentation helps users and support teams to understand and resolve issues when they occur. It also improves the SEO.

In order for HubRise to start the documentation process, it is recommended to provide some elements, like a logo, a description, and a few screenshots of the app to illustrate your page. It will allow us to better explain the specificities of your solution.

## Apps

In order for your app to be included on the [Apps Page](/apps), you need to provide the following elements:

- A high resolution logo, in PNG format, with a transparent background. The final size is 250x130px, but no need to resize it, this can be done by the HubRise team.
- A description of 30 to 35 words, without superlative, that allows to differenciate the solution from the other listed on this page.

## Overview

For the Overview Page, which is the first visible page in the documentation of a solution, the following elements are needed:

- A description of 150 to 250 words, without superlative, that presents the solution and its features in details.
- From 2 to 6 pictures of the app, all with the same ratio width/height.

## Partners

For the Partners Page, the following elements are needed:
