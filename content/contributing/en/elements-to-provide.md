In order for HubRise to start the documentation process, you need to provide some elements, like a logo, a description, and a few screenshots of the app.

## Apps

For the [Apps Page](/apps), you need to provide the following elements:

- A high resolution logo, in PNG format, with a transparent background. The final size is 250x130px, but no need to resize it, this can be done by the HubRise team.
- A description of 30 to 35 words, without superlative, that allows to differenciate the solution from the other listed on this page.

## Overview

For the Overview Page, which is the first visible page in the documentation of a solution, the following elements are needed:

- A description of 150 to 250 words, without superlative, that presents the solution and its features in details.
- From 2 to 6 pictures of the app, all with the same ratio width/height.

To see an example of this page, visit the [LivePepper documentation](/apps/livepepper).

## Partners

For the Partners Page, the following elements are needed:

- A logo.
- A description, displayed as 2 subsections of around 45 words each.

This page does not exist yet, but will be added very soon.
