In order for HubRise to start the documentation process, editors need to provide some elements, like a logo, a description, and a few images of the app.

## Apps

For the [Apps Page](/apps), editors need to provide the following elements:

- A high resolution logo, in PNG format, with a transparent background. The final size is 250x130px, but no need to resize it, this can be done by the HubRise team.
- A description of 30 to 35 words, without superlative, that can differenciate the solution from the other listed on this page.

## Overview

For the Overview Page, specific to every solution, the following elements are needed:

- A description of 150 to 250 words, without superlative, that presents the solution and its features in details.
- From 2 to 6 pictures of the solution, all with the same orientation (portrait or landscape) and the same ratio width/height.

To see an example of what such a page looks like, visit the [LivePepper Page](/apps/livepepper).

## Partners

For the Partners Page, the following elements are needed:

- A logo.
- A description that is intended to be displayed as 2 subsections of around 45 words each.

This page is not yet implemented, but will be very soon.
