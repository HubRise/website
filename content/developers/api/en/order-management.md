## 1. Orders

### 1.1. Create Order

This method creates an order.

Almost all the fields are optional. In fact the simplest order that can be created only has a `status`.

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="POST /locations/:location_id/orders"
  shortEndpoint="POST /location/orders (location only)"
  accessLevel="location, account"
/>

##### Parameters:

### 1.2. Retrieve Order

Returns an order resource.

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="GET /locations/:location_id/orders/:order_id"
  shortEndpoint="GET /location/orders/:order_id (location only)"
  accessLevel="location, account"
/>

All the fields of an order creation request are returned, plus a few more:

| Name          | Type                                                       | Description                                                                  |

| ...           |                                                            | See the [order creation fields](#create-order).                              |
| `id`          | string                                                     | Unique id of the order, generated by HubRise.                                |
| `location_id` | string                                                     | The id of the location where the order was created.                          |
| `created_at`  | [Time](/developers/api/general-concepts/#dates-and-times)  | Order creation time.                                                         |
| `created_by`  | string                                                     | Name of the API client that created the order.                               |
| `total`       | [Money](/developers/api/general-concepts/#monetary-values) | Order total amount. Calculated by HubRise from items, charges and discounts. |
| `customer`    | [Customer](#order-s-customer)                              | Customer details at the time of the order creation.                          |

**Note:** `total_discrepancy` and `payment_discrepancy` fields are also returned, but these fields are deprecated and their values should not be used.

In addition, each `item`, `charge`, `payment` and `discount` is returned with a HubRise generated `id`, which uniquely identifies the resource and can be used to delete it. See [Update Order](#update-order).

### 1.4. Update Order

Updates an order.

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="PATCH /locations/:location_id/orders/:order_id"
  shortEndpoint="PATCH /location/orders/:order_id (location only)"
  accessLevel="location, account"
/>

The following fields can be updated by sending their new value:

- `status`
- `confirmed_time`
- `seller_notes`
- `collection_code`
- `private_ref`
- `custom_fields`

You can also delete or add elements to the following collections, and set their private ref:

- `items`
- `discounts`
- `charges`
- `payments`

<details>

<summary>Example request</summary>

This request changes the order status to `accepted`, deletes an item, and adds a payment.

`PATCH /locations/3r4s3-1/orders/5dpm9`

```json
{
  "status": "accepted",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "xe834v",
      "deleted": true
    }
  ],
  "payments": [

}
```

</details>

Further in this section, **element** will interchangeably refer to an item, a charge, a payment, or a discount.

### Delete elements

To delete an element, pass the `id` field along with `"deleted": true`. No other fields should be included.

Deleted elements are still present in the order representation, but they are irreversibly marked as deleted. Their `deleted` field cannot be reverted to `false`.

<summary>Example request</summary>

`PATCH /locations/3r4s3-1/orders/5dpm9`

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "xe834v",
      "deleted": true
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Response:

```json

```

</details>

### Set private refs on elements

It is possible to set a private ref on each element. To do so, pass the `id` and `private_ref` fields. No other fields should be included.

Private refs are typically used to map HubRise objects with the client's internal objects. See [Private Refs](/developers/api/general-concepts#private-refs) for more information.

<details>

<summary>Example request</summary>

This request sets a private ref on an item.

`PATCH /locations/3r4s3-1/orders/5dpm9`

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "xe834v",
      "private_ref": "96"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Response:

```json

## 2. Order's Customer

When you create an order, you can attach a customer to it. You usually want to do this, unless no customer identifier is available. An order with no attached customer is called a **guest order**.

When customers are uniquely identified, we recommend attaching customers to orders. This not only allows tracking of orders placed by a single customer, but it is also a requirement for some POS systems to successfully process orders.

Guest orders can however be useful in a limited number of cases, such as:

- Orders placed on a self ordering kiosk, where no customer identification is usually available.
- Orders placed on an online platform not willing to share unique identifiers for their customers.

### Order with an attached customer

There are two ways to create an order with an attached customer:

- By passing `customer_id` in the order creation request as in the example below. If a customer with this id exists, it is attached to the order, otherwise an error is returned.

```json
{
  "status": "new",
  "customer_id": "ve343",
  "items": [...]
}
```

- By passing `customer_list_id` and `customer_private_ref` simultaneously. If a customer with this private ref exists in this customer list, it is attached to the order, otherwise an error is returned.

```json
{
  "status": "new",
  "customer_list_id": "ag8u4",
  "customer_private_ref": "charles@dummy-mail.org",
  "items": [...]
}
```

When you retrieve an order using a GET request, you will find the customer fields encoded in a `customer` object. The `customer` object contains the customer values _at the time of the order creation_.

The presence of a `id` field with a non-null value in the `order.customer` object indicates that the order is attached to this customer. Conversely, a null value indicates a guest order.

### Order with no attached customer (guest order)

To create a guest order, simply omit the `customer_id`, `customer_list_id`, and `customer_private_ref` fields in the order creation request. Doing so "unlocks" a `customer` object, which you can optionally use to pass customer data relative to this order, as in the following `POST /location/orders` request:

```json
{
  "status": "new",
  "customer": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe"
  },
  "items": [...]
}
```

The following fields are available in the `customer` object:

- `email`
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `gender`
- `birth_date`
- `company_name`
- `phone`
- `phone_access_code`
- `address_1`
- `address_2`
- `postal_code`
- `city`
- `state`
- `country`
- `latitude`
- `longitude`
- `delivery_notes`
- `sms_marketing`
- `email_marketing`

When you retrieve a guest order, the customer fields passed at creation time are returned in the `customer` object, along with a few fields computed by HubRise.

## 3. Order Status

The status of an order. Used in the order's `status` field.

Here are the possible "normal" values, and their meaning:

| Name                  | Description                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `new`                 | Order placed but not received yet in the EPOS. Default status for a new order placed outside of the EPOS (eg an online order). |
| `received`            | Order which was previously new, but it has later been received by the POS.                                                     |
| `accepted`            | Order accepted by the store. Default status for an order created from within the POS.                                          |
| `in_preparation`      | Order is being prepared.                                                                                                       |
| `awaiting_shipment`   | Order is ready to be shipped.                                                                                                  |
| `awaiting_collection` | Order is ready to be collected by the customer.                                                                                |
| `in_delivery`         | Order has been sent out for delivery.                                                                                          |
| `completed`           | Order successfully delivered to the customer.                                                                                  |

These additional statuses can be used in the event of an anomaly:

| Name              | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rejected`        | Order could not be transmitted to the store, generally because of a system error. |
| `cancelled`       | Order has been cancelled by either the customer or the store.                     |
| `delivery_failed` | Order could not be delivered.                                                     |

Orders do not have to go through all steps. The sequence actually depends on the use case. Let's consider two sample scenarios and a possible workflow for each:

#### Delivery order placed online:

1. `new` (order placed online)
1. `received` (received in the POS)
1. `accepted` (accepted by a store operator)
1. `in_delivery`
1. `completed`

#### Retail order created in the POS:

1. `accepted` (order placed in the POS)
1. `completed`

## 4. Order Items

## 5. Order Items in a Deal

Order items which are part of a deal include a `deal_line` field. This field is an object with the following fields:

| Name                                       | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `deal_key`                                 | string  | A key in the order's `deals` object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `label` <Label type="optional" />          | string  | Content of the deal line, for instance "Drink".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `pricing_effect` <Label type="optional" /> | string  | One of: `unchanged`, `fixed_price`, `price_off`, `percentage_off`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `pricing_value` <Label type="optional" />  | depends | The presence and value of this field depends on `pricing_effect`. It is a [Money](/developers/api/general-concepts/#monetary-values) for `fixed_price` and `price_off`, a [decimal](/developers/api/general-concepts/#decimal-values) between "0" and "100" for `percentage_off`, and `null` for `unchanged`. |

`deal_key` associates an order item to a particular order deal. The particular value of a key has no significance and HubRise renumbers the keys to: "0", "1", … When an order is created, every `deal_key` must have a corresponding entry in the order's `deals` field or the request will fail.

`pricing_effect` and `pricing_value` can be useful in some applications but can generally be omitted. HubRise does not make any computation with these fields.

## 6. Order Options

| Name                                 | Type                                                       | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `option_list_name`                   | string                                                     | The name of the list the option belongs to, eg. "Toppings", "Sauce", etc.                     |
| `name`                               | string                                                     | The option name.                                                                              |
| `ref` <Label type="optional" />      | string                                                     | The optional ref of the option.                                                               |
| `price` <Label type="optional" />    | [Money](/developers/api/general-concepts/#monetary-values) | The unit price of the option. If omitted the option is free.                                  |
| `quantity` <Label type="optional" /> | integer                                                    | The number of selections for this option, relative to a single item unit. Default: `1`.       |
| `removed` <Label type="optional" />  | boolean                                                    | When this flag is true, the option is removed (for instance, a removed ingredient in a dish). |

##### Example:

```json
{
  "option_list_name": "Sauce",
  "name": "Barbecue",
  "ref": "BBQ",
  "price": "1.00 EUR",
  "quantity": 1
}
```

A removed option can define a `price`. In this case, it's the price charged to the customer to remove the option.

## 7. Order Deals

An order deal associates an order item's `deal_key` to a particular deal.

##### Attributes:

| Name                            | Type   | Description                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |

| `ref` <Label type="optional" /> | string | The ref that identifies the deal. |

##### Example:

```json
{
  "0": {
    "name": "Buy a dessert, get a drink for 1€",
    "ref": "FREEDRINK"
  }
}
```

## 8. Order Discounts

An order discount is a discount applied to the whole order, as opposed to deals which apply to a set of order items.

##### Attributes:

| Name                                    | Type                                                       | Description                                                                                                        |

| `name`                                  | string                                                     | The name of the discount.                                                                                          |
| `ref` <Label type="optional" />         | string                                                     | The ref that identifies the discount.                                                                              |
| `price_off`                             | [Money](/developers/api/general-concepts/#monetary-values) | The discount value.                                                                                                |
| `deleted` <Label type="optional" />     | boolean                                                    | `false` by default. Setting this field to `true` marks the resource as irreversibly deleted.                       |

**Note:** the `pricing_effect` and `pricing_value` fields are deprecated. They are still present in the API output for backwards compatibility, but their values should be ignored.

##### Example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "5€ off your order",
    "ref": "5OFF",
    "price_off": "5.00 EUR"
  },
  {
    "name": "30% off your order",
    "ref": "30OFF",
    "price_off": "7.65 EUR"
  }
]
```

## 9. Order Charges

Order charges increase the price paid by the customer.

##### Attributes:

| Name                                    | Type                                                        | Description                                                                                                      |

**Note:** the `charge_type`, `charge_price` and `charge_ref` fields are deprecated. They are present in the API for backwards compatibility, but their values should be ignored.

**Note:** the `type` field is deprecated and should be ignored in new integrations.

##### Example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Delivery < 15 km",
    "ref": "DEL",
    "price": "1.50 EUR"
  }
]
```

## 10. Order Payments

If one or several payments are defined, the sum of the payment amounts should equal the order's `total`. Otherwise, the difference is stored in the order's `payment_discrepancy` field.

If payments are omitted, the order should be considered as unpaid.

##### Attributes:

| Name                                    | Type                                                       | Description                                                                                                           |

```

## 11. Order Loyalty Operations

Add or remove points to a customer's loyalty card(s).

Each operation is linked to a loyalty card, uniquely identified by its name. If a card does not exist with this name, it is created automatically with an initial balance equal to 0.0

Each loyalty operation triggers the automatic recalculation of the loyalty card balance.

##### Attributes:

## 12. Tax Rates

A `tax_rate` can be specified for each order item and order charge.

Tax rate are decimal numbers, representing a percentage of the price. For example, `tax_rate="15.5"` means that the tax is 15.5% of the price of the item or charge.

Whether prices are tax-inclusive or exclusive is a decision taken at the account level. The chosen convention must then be enforced by all clients connected to the account. As a general rule, you can assume that prices in HubRise are **tax-inclusive** for accounts situated in markets where consumer prices are tax-inclusive, for example European countries. On the contrary, prices can generally be considered as **tax-exclusive** in the other markets, for example the U.S.

HubRise does not perform any computation with `tax_rate`, and does not require this field to be present. If needed, use a default value for items with unspecified tax rates.
