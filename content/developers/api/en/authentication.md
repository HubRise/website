## 1. Introduction to OAuth 2.0

Before your application can access data on HubRise, you need to request your users' permission. The HubRise API relies on the OAuth 2.0 protocol for this purpose.

The OAuth 2.0 flow is a series of interactions between:

- A **resource owner**: the HubRise user.
- A **client**: your application, which makes requests on behalf of the user.
- An **authorisation server**: the HubRise OAuth API, which issues an access token to the client. Hosted on: http://manager.hubrise.com/oauth2/v1.
- A **resource server**: the HubRise API, which provides access to your users' data. Hosted on: http://api.hubrise.com/v1.

Although it seems complicated at first, OAuth actually makes things simpler for both you and your users, and it dramatically reduces security risks for everyone:

- Your application doesn't need to store your users' passwords.
- Your application can only access the data that it needs. For example, your application can request access to orders but not catalogs. Or it can request read-only access.
- Users can easily revoke access to a potentially insecure or compromised application, without resetting their password.

## 2. OAuth scopes {#oauth-scopes}

A _scope_ controls the set of resources an application has access to. Users can see the scope before granting access to an application. The good practice is to limit your application's scope to the minimum it needs: not only does this reduce the impact of a potential security breach, it also makes your users more comfortable authorising your application.

### Syntax

A scope combines an **access-level set of permissions** and **general permissions**. Both are optional, but at least one must be present. They are comma separated when used together.

An **access-level set of permissions** is made of an access-level keyword, which can be `location` or `account`, followed by a comma separated list of permissions between square brackets.

Each permission consists of a resource, which can be `orders`, `customer_list`, `catalog`, `all_customer_lists`, or `all_catalogs`, and an access right keyword, which can be `read` or `write`, separated with a dot.

**General permissions** can be `profile`, or `profile_with_email`.

### Example of scopes

- `profile`: Gives your application access to the user profile.
- `location[orders.read,customer_list.read]`: Gives your application read access to the orders and customers from the selected location and customer list.
- `account[customer_list.read],profile`: Gives your application access to the user profile, and read access to the customers from the selected customer list.

### User input and API allowances for each permission

- `profile`:

  - The user does not select any resource.
  - Your application can access the profile of the user.

- `profile_with_email`:

  - The user does not select any resource.
  - Your application can access the profile of the user, including their email.

- `location[orders.read]` and `location[orders.write]`:
  - The user selects a location.
  - Your application can read the location's orders. With the `write` scope, it can also create orders in the location, and update any location's order.
- `account[orders.read]` and `account[orders.write]`:

  - The user selects an account.
  - Your application can read the orders of any location of the account. With the `write` scope, it can also create and update orders in any location of the account.

- `location[catalog.read]` and `location[catalog.write]`:

  - The user selects a location, and a catalog belonging to the selected location or to the location's account.
  - Your application can read the catalog. With the `write` scope, it can also update the catalog, even if it belongs to the account.

- `account[catalog.read]` and `account[catalog.write]`:

  - The user selects an account, and a catalog belonging to the account or to any location of the account.
  - Your application can read the catalog. With the `write` scope, it can also update the catalog.

- `location[all_catalogs.read]` and `location[all_catalogs.write]`:

  - The user selects a location.
  - Your application can read any catalog belonging to the location or the location's account. With the `write` scope, it can create catalogs in the location, update or delete any catalog belonging to the location, but it cannot update or delete catalogs belonging to the account.

- `account[all_catalogs.read]` and `account[all_catalogs.write]`:
  - The user selects an account.
  - Your application can read any catalog belonging to the account or any of its locations. With the `write` scope, it can also update any of the catalogs, and it can create catalogs in the account or in any location of the account.

The `customer_list` and `all_customer_lists` resources work similarly to `catalog` and `all_catalogs`.

## 3. Web Application Workflow

### 3.1. Request Authorisation

To get access to a user's data, your application should redirect the user to this page:

```http
https://manager.hubrise.com/oauth2/v1/authorize?
  redirect_uri=https://<<YOUR-DOMAIN-HERE>>/oauth_callback&
  client_id=<<YOUR-CLIENT-ID>>&
  scope=location[orders.write,customer_list.write,catalog.read]&
  country=FR&
  account_name=Aux+DÃ©lices&
  location_name=Paris
```

When the page loads, HubRise:

- Authenticates the user. Users can log in if they already have a HubRise account. If they don't, they can create an account in a few simple steps: `country`, `account_name` and `location_name` parameters are then used to prefill the signup form.
- Prompts the user to select the location, catalog and/or customer list to connect.
- Requests user approval to access the data.

If the user approves the request, HubRise calls the `redirect_uri` URL you specified, and includes the authorisation code in the `code` query parameter:

```http
https://<<YOUR-DOMAIN-HERE>>/oauth_callback?code=ffae0047c4d6b9e02f95e76a3f6e906d
```

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Authorisation codes are one-use throw-away codes that expire after 10 minutes. They are used to generate API tokens, which do not expire. The next section explains how to get an API token from an authorisation code.

---

If the authorisation fails, HubRise calls the `redirect_uri` URL, with an error message in the `error` query parameter:

```http
https://<<YOUR-DOMAIN-HERE>>/oauth_callback?error=access_denied
```

### 3.2. Get an Access Token

Once your application gets an authorisation code, it can establish a connection. This step is necessary to get an access token and start sending requests to the API.

To get the access token, send a `POST` request with your client id and secret passed in the HTTP Basic `Authorization` header, and include the authorisation code in the request body.

```http
POST https://manager.hubrise.com/oauth2/v1/token HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudF9zZWNyZXQ=
---
code=ffae0047c4d6b9e02f95e76a3f6e906d
```

The `Authorization` header is the base64-encoded concatenation of the client id and secret, separated by a colon. If you cannot use HTTP Basic, you can pass `client_id` and `client_secret` in the request body instead, but this is not recommended and only supported for backwards compatibility.

The request must be sent from a server, not a browser, to prevent a CORS error. This is because sending the request from a browser would expose your client secret to malicious users. For more information about our CORS policies, see [CORS](/developers/api/general-concepts#cors).

If the request succeeds, the server returns a `200` response containing the access token. You must save this token, as you will need to include it in all further requests to the API.

The response also contains the ids and names of the resources your application has access to. You should save these identifiers and make them easily accessible from your user interface. They are a convenient way for users to confirm that their connection is bound to the right resources.

##### Example of response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "b9922a78d3ffab6b95e9d72e88",
  "account_id": "3r4s3",
  "location_id": "3r4s3-1",
  "catalog_id": "psmlf",
  "customer_list_id": "xab66",
  "account_name": "Bella Pizza",
  "location_name": "Paris",
  "catalog_name": "Bella Pizza",
  "customer_list_name": "Bella Pizza"
}
```

The request fails with a `400` status code if the authorisation code has expired or has already been used. It fails with a `401` status code if the client id or secret are incorrect.

### 3.3. Connect to the API

With the access token, your application can now call the API on behalf of the user. Calls to the API must include a `X-Access-Token` HTTP header.

For example, you can use this request to get location details:

```http
GET https://api.hubrise.com/v1/location HTTP/1.1
X-Access-Token: b9922a78d3ffab6b95e9d72e88
```

Note that you don't need to specify a location's id, because your connection is bound to a single location.

### 3.4 Revoke an Access Token

When you no longer need an access token, you can revoke it. This is done by sending a `POST` request to the `/oauth2/v1/revoke` endpoint, passing the access token in the request body.

```http
POST https://manager.hubrise.com/oauth2/v1/revoke HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudF9zZWNyZXQ=
---
token=b9922a78d3ffab6b95e9d72e88
```

This request must be sent from a server, not a browser, to prevent a CORS error and protect your client secret. For more information about our CORS policies, see [CORS](/developers/api/general-concepts#cors).

If the server returns a `200` response, the access token is revoked and can no longer be used.

## 4. Installed App Workflow

The preceding workflow is not convenient for installed apps, as they generally cannot expose a callback URL to the outside.

We offer an alternative workflow suitable for these apps. The main difference is that the authorisation code appears in the browser, and the user needs to copy/paste the code into your application.

To implement this workflow, simply redirect users to the following page in their default browser:

```http
https://manager.hubrise.com/oauth2/v1/authorize?
  redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&
  client_id=<<YOUR-CLIENT-ID>>&
  scope=location[orders.write,customer_list.write,catalog.read]&
  country=FR&
  account_name=Aux+DÃ©lices&
  location_name=Paris
```

Here, `redirect_uri` contains a special `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` value, that tells HubRise to display the authorisation code in the browser, rather than sending the code to a callback URL.

After granting access, the user is redirected to a page where the authorisation code appears. Your application must provide an input field for the user to type or paste the code. Your application can then use the code to request an access token, in the same way as a web application.

Note that you will need to ship your client secret within your application binary to implement this workflow.

## 5. Connection Reuse

The `access_token` returned by `GET /oauth2/v1/token` is specific to a given client and a given location. Re-authorising the same location with the same client always returns the same token.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: if a different catalog (or customer list) is selected when re-authorising the location, the token will no
longer allow access to the former catalog (or customer list) when the new authorisation completes.

---

You can bypass this behaviour and force a new token to be issued by passing a `device_id` parameter when redirecting the
user to the authorisation page, eg:

```http
GET https://manager.hubrise.com/oauth2/v1/authorize?device_id=100&redirect_uri=https://YOUR-DOMAIN-HERE.com/oauth_callback&client_id=459691768564.clients.hubrise.com&scope=location[orders.write,customer_list.write,catalog.read] HTTP/1.1
```

If the provided `device_id` has never been authorised for the location, a new access token is returned. Otherwise,
the access token previously associated with this `device_id` is returned.

## 6. Token Invalidity

At times, access tokens may become invalid, leading to request failures with a `429` status code. Token invalidity can arise from:

- Non-payment of subscription.
- Manual disconnection from the HubRise back office.
- Temporary blocking from the HubRise back office.

Here are the recommended steps to handle such situations:

- **Minimise side effects**: Ensure that a `429` error does not create widespread disruptions. For example, it should not prevent customers from placing orders, but alert the user (the business employee) instead.
- **Flag the connection**: Implement a `last_failed_at` timestamp for each connection. Set it to the current timestamp when a `429` error occurs, and reset to `null` on successful request completion.
- **Alert the user**: Show a message to the user when `last_failed_at` is set, e.g., "All requests failed since [timestamp]. Reconnect HubRise to resolve.".

When the user reconnects, the following will happen:

- For non-payment issues, the HubRise authorisation page will display a message indicating the issue.
- For disconnections and blocks, reconnection via the integrated application will resolve the issue.
