**Note:** the `timezone.offset` field is deprecated and should not be used, as it does not take daylight saving time into account.

#### Opening Hours {#opening-hours}

The `opening_hours` field represents the opening hours for a location on each day of the week: `monday`, `tuesday`, etc. You can provide multiple time slots for each day, specifying the `from` and `to` times in the `HH:mm` format. For example:

```json
{
  "opening_hours": {
    "monday": [
      {
        "from": "12:00",
        "to": "14:00"
      },
      {
        "from": "18:00",
        "to": "01:00" // Same day because 01:00 is before the cutoff time (= 06:00)
      }
    ]
    // ... other days of the week
  }
}
```

You can skip some days, in which case the location will be considered closed on those days, but at least one time slot must be provided for the week.

For each time slot, `to` must follow `from`. Additionally, there must be no overlap between time slots of the same day.

The `cutoff_time` is a location level field, with a default value of `06:00`. It allows time slots to span across midnight. In the example above, the second time slot ends at `01:00`, which is considered on the same day as `18:00`, because `01:00` is before the `cutoff_time`. If the `cutoff_time` was `00:00`, `01:00` would be considered on the next day and the API would return an error.

#### Order Acceptance {#order-acceptance}

Controls whether a location is currently accepting new orders. Three modes are available:

- `normal`: The location is accepting orders normally.
- `busy`: The location is accepting orders with a delay. The `extra_preparation_time` field specifies the additional time added to the base `preparation_time`.
- `paused`: The location is not accepting orders. The `reason` field can be used to provide a free-text explanation.

The `order_acceptance` object has the following fields:

| Name                                  | Type                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mode`                                | `normal` \| `busy` \| `paused`                           | Current acceptance mode.                                                                                                                        |
| `resume_at` <Label type="optional" /> | [Time](/developers/api/general-concepts#dates-and-times) | Timestamp at which `mode` automatically reverts to `normal`, when mode is `busy` or `paused`. If `null`, the location must be updated manually. |
| `extra_preparation_time`              | integer                                                  | Additional minutes added to `preparation_time`, when mode is `busy`.                                                                            |
| `reason` <Label type="optional" />    | string                                                   | Free-text explanation shown to customers, when mode is `paused`.                                                                                |

### 1.2 Update Location

Updates a location.

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="PATCH /locations/:id"
  shortEndpoint="PATCH /location (location only)"
  accessLevel="location, account"
/>

The following fields can be updated: `cutoff_time`, `opening_hours`, `preparation_time`, `order_acceptance`, and `custom_fields`.

If the `order_acceptance` object is provided, it must match one of the following templates:

```jsonc
// Accepting orders normally
{
  "mode": "normal"
}

// Accepting with delay
{
  "mode": "busy",
  "resume_at": <ISO-8601 timestamp>    // optional
  "extra_preparation_time": <integer>, // required
}

// Not accepting orders
{
  "mode": "paused",
  "resume_at": <ISO-8601 timestamp>,   // optional
  "reason": <string>                   // optional
}
```
