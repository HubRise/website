**Note:** the `timezone.offset` field is deprecated and should not be used, as it does not take daylight saving time into account.

#### Opening Hours

The `opening_hours` field represents the opening hours for a location on each day of the week: `monday`, `tuesday`, etc. You can provide multiple time slots for each day, specifying the `from` and `to` times in the `HH:mm` format. For example:

```json
{
  "opening_hours": {
    "monday": [
      {
        "from": "12:00",
        "to": "14:00"
      },
      {
        "from": "18:00",
        "to": "01:00" // Next day because 01:00 is before the cutoff time of 06:00
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

For each time slot, `to` must follow `from`. Additionally, there must be no overlap between time slots of the same day.

The `cutoff_time` is a location level field, with a default value of `06:00`. It allows time slots to span across midnight. In the example above, the second time slot ends at `01:00`, which is considered on the same day as `18:00`, because `01:00` is before the `cutoff_time`. If the `cutoff_time` was `00:00`, `01:00` would be considered on the next day and the API would return an error.

### 1.2 Update Location

Updates a location.

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="PATCH /locations/:id"
  shortEndpoint="PATCH /location (location only)"
  accessLevel="location, account"
/>

The following fields can be updated: `cutoff_time`, `opening_hours`, and `custom_fields`.
