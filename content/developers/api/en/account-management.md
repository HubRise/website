**Note:** the `timezone.offset` field is deprecated and should not be used, as it does not take into account daylight saving time.

#### Opening Times

The `opening_times` field represents the opening hours for a location on each day of the week. Each day (`monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) is optional, and you can provide an array of time slots for each day, specifying the `from` and `to` times in the `HH:mm` format.

The `cutoff_time` field, which has a default value of `06:00`, is used to compare times in case an opening time slot spans across midnight. For instance, `03:00` is considered greater than `23:00` if the cutoff time is set to `06:00`.

When providing opening times, ensure that the `to` time is greater than the `from` time for each time slot, and that there is no overlap between time slots of the same day. HubRise will automatically sort opening times by day of the week, from Monday to Sunday, and skip days with no time slots provided, before saving them.

### 1.2 Update Location

Updates a location.

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="PATCH /locations/:id"
  shortEndpoint="PATCH /location (location only)"
  accessLevel="location, account"
/>

The following fields can be updated: `cutoff_time`, `opening_times`, and `custom_fields`.
