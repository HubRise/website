## 1. Customer Lists

Like catalogs, customer lists exist at either location or account level.

Name unicity is ruled by the same constraints as catalogs:

- At the location level, customer lists are uniquely identified by their name.
- An account level customer list cannot have the same name as another account or location level customer list.

### 1.1. Retrieve Customer List

Returns a customer list.

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="GET /customer_lists/:customer_list_id"
  accessLevel="location, account"
/>

#### Example request:

`GET /customer_lists/ag8u4`

```json
{
  "id": "ag8u4",
  "name": "Online customers"
}
```

### 1.2. List Customer Lists

Returns a location's Customer Lists. Includes location and account level Customer Lists.

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="GET /locations/:location_id/customer_lists"
  shortEndpoint="GET /location/customer_lists (location only)"
  accessLevel="location, account"
/>

Account level Customer Lists of an account:

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="GET /accounts/:account_id/customer_lists"
  shortEndpoint="GET /account/customer_lists (account only)"
  accessLevel="account"
/>

#### Example request:

`GET /locations/3r4s3-1/customer_lists`

```json
[
  {
    "id": "apm3s",
    "name": "Online customers",
    "created_at": "2020-06-25T11:43:51+02:00"
  },
  {
    "id": "s7ma5",
    "name": "POS customers",
    "created_at": "2020-05-19T13:23:10+02:00"
  }
]
```

### 1.3. Create Customer List

Creates a new customer list.

To create a location-level customer list, use this request:

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="POST /locations/:location_id/customer_lists"
  shortEndpoint="POST /location/customer_lists (location only)"
  accessLevel="location, account"
/>

To create an account-level customer list:

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="POST /accounts/:account_id/customer_lists"
  shortEndpoint="POST /account/customer_lists (account only)"
  accessLevel="account"
/>

#### Request parameters:

| Name   | Type   | Description                    |
| ------ | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| `name` | string | The name of the customer list. |

#### Example request:

`POST /locations/3r4s3-1/customer_lists`

```json
{
  "name": "Web customers"
}
```

If a customer list with the same name already exists, it returns an error.

### 1.4. Update Customer List

Update a customer list.

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="PUT /customer_lists/:id"
  accessLevel="location, account"
/>

#### Example request:

`PUT /customer_lists/apm3s`

```json
{
  "name": "New customers"
}
```

If `name` is used by another customer list, it returns an error.

### 1.5. Delete Customer List

Delete a customer list. Customers and loyalty cards belonging to the list are also deleted.

No event is fired in the process.

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="DELETE /customer_lists/:id"
  accessLevel="location, account"
/>

#### Example request:

`DELETE /customer_lists/apm3s`

## 2. Customers

(\*) The E.164 format must be used for any new implementation. Be aware however that phone numbers retrieved from the API can be encoded in a different format. The E.164 will become mandatory in a future release.

#### Example request:

`POST /customer_lists/ag8u4/customers`

```json
{
  "private_ref": "2213312",
  "email": "charles.moore@dummy-mail.org",
  "first_name": "Charles",
  "last_name": "Moore",
  "gender": "male",
  "birth_date": "1999-01-01",
  "company_name": "HubRise",
  "phone": "+44123456789",
  "address_1": "1 avenue des Champs Elysées",
  "address_2": null,
  "postal_code": "75001",
  "city": "Paris",
  "state": null,
  "country": "FR",
  "latitude": "48.8589507",
  "longitude": "2.2770205"
}
```

### 2.4. Update Customer

Updates a customer. Only the fields present in the request are updated.

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="PATCH /customer_lists/:customer_list_id/customers/:customer_id"
  accessLevel="location, account"
/>

#### Example request:

`PATCH /customer_lists/ag8u4/customers/asdf2`

```json
{
  "first_name": "Claude"
}
```

### 2.5. Anonymise Customer

Deletes a customer's personal information.

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="POST /customer_lists/:customer_list_id/customers/:customer_id/anonymise"
  accessLevel="location, account"
/>

The anonymised fields are: `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `gender`, `birth_date`, `company_name`, `phone`, `address_1`, `address_2`, `postal_code`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `delivery_notes`.

When a customer is anonymised, the anonymised fields retun a `null` value and the `anonymised` boolean field is set to `true`.

Anonymization cannot be reverted. Further updates of the anonymised fields will silently be ignored. The other fields (eg `custom_fields`) can still be updated though.

Anonymizing a customer also anonymises his/her orders. The `customer` resources of anonymised orders are modified in the same way as described above.

When a customer is anonymised, an [Event](/api/callbacks/#events) with an `update` type is triggered for the customer and for each affected order.

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="POST /customer_lists/:customer_list_id/customers/:customer_id/anonymise"
  accessLevel="location, account"
/>

#### Example request:

`POST /customer_lists/ag8u4/customers/asdf2/anonymise`

## 3. Loyalty Cards

### 3.1. Retrieve Loyalty Card

Returns a loyalty card.

A customer can have zero, one or many loyalty cards.

`name` identifies the loyalty scheme or the name of a particular campaign. Each card must have a unique name for any given customer. An empty ("") name is acceptable and will generally be used for a location running a unique loyalty program.

The `ref` must be unique for a given customer list and a given name.

The `balance` is updated automatically by HubRise when a loyalty operation is created. This field cannot be changed through the API.

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="GET /customer_lists/:customer_list_id/loyalty_cards/:loyalty_card_id"
  accessLevel="location, account"

| `name`                          | string | The loyalty card scheme name. Must be unique among the cards owned by the same customer. Mandatory parameter, but " is an acceptable value. |
| `ref` <Label type="optional" /> | string | The unique reference of the card. If defined, it must be unique among all the cards of the same customer list having the same name.         |

#### Example request:

`POST /customer_lists/smpre3/loyalty_cards`

```json
{
  "customer_id": "ve343",
  "name": "",
  "ref": "av-33489"
}
```

If the request succeeds, the loyalty card is created with an initial `balance` set to `"0.0"`.

### 3.4. Update Loyalty Card

Update a loyalty card.

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="PUT /customer_lists/:customer_list_id/loyalty_cards/:loyalty_card_id"
  accessLevel="location, account"
/>

#### Request parameters:

| Name                             | Type   | Description                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `name` <Label type="optional" /> | string | The loyalty card scheme name.     |
| `ref` <Label type="optional" />  | string | The unique reference of the card. |

#### Example request:

`PUT /customer_lists/smpre3/loyalty_cards/slp8q`

```json
{
  "ref": "av-20103"
}
```

Note that only the name and the ref can be updated. It's not possible to change the `customer_id`.

`balance` cannot be changed directly as well. To update it, just create an operation.

| `order_id` <Label type="optional" /> | string                                                      | Attach this operation to a particular order. If defined, an order with this id must exist or the request will fail. An order can be attached to several operations. |
| `reason` <Label type="optional" />   | string                                                      | Describes how the points were obtained/redeemed. The customer will typically see this field when he checks his loyalty account operations from a website.           |
| `delta`                              | [decimal](/developers/api/general-concepts/#decimal-values) | The number of points to add to the customer balance. Use a negative number to remove points.                                                                        |

#### Example request:

`POST /customer_lists/smpre3/loyalty_cards/slp8q/operations`

```json
{
  "order_id": "mapcm",
  "reason": "Points earned",
  "delta": "4.2"
}
```

If the request succeeds, the operation's `new_balance` is automatically calculated, as well as the customer's `balance`.

A loyalty operation cannot be deleted or updated. If you need to void a loyalty operation, create an opposite operation.
