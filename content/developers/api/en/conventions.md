Over time, partners integrated to HubRise have established conventions to use the API and to cover edge use cases. A number of solutions follow these conventions, and we can consider them as a de facto standard.

We chose to document conventions in a separate chapter, as they are not strictly enforced by the API. Nonetheless, you should learn and follow them in order to make your solution operate seamlessly with other integrated solutions.

## Conventions for restaurants

### Half & half items

Half & half items are a relatively common occurrence in the restaurant industry, especially in the pizzeria industry. A half & half product lets you mix two recipes, and customise each of them separately. Think of a half & half pizza as a normal size pizza split in two halves, each half having its own ingredients.
