A delivery can optionally be attached to an order. This tracks the delivery details, including estimated pickup and drop-off times, driver information, and delivery status.

### 1. Create a Delivery

Attaches a delivery to an order.

<CallSummaryTable
endpoint="POST /locations/:location_id/orders/:order_id/delivery"
shortEndpoint="POST /location/orders/:order_id/delivery (location only)"
accessLevel="Location, Account"
/>

This endpoint can only be called if:

- The order has no delivery yet.
- The order's `service_type` is set to `delivery`.
