## Overview

This guide will help you to get started with the HubRise API. At the end of the process, you will know how to send an order to HubRise. And the best part is that you will not have to write a single line of code!

## Getting Started

### Create a HubRise Account

First of all, you need to create a user profile on HubRise with an account and an associated location. It is free, and only takes a few minutes! Just click on the **Sign up** button on the top of this page and follow instructions.

This account will be the first user of your application. 
[comment]: # (NOT SURE THE ABOVE SENTENCE MAKES SENSE. AN ACCOUNT IS NOT A USER.....)
It will be useful to have it for testing during the development process.

### Set up Postman

Postman is an API development environment that makes sending API requests very easy.

- Download and install [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).
- Download the [HubRise API Postman Bundle](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fn5u-4sY0-bnrxJY9RFPvpCu0bANGNBd?usp=sharing) and import the folder into Postman.

### Create the OAuth Client

Then, you need to create an OAuth 2.0 client for your application.

- Log in to the [HubRise back office](https://manager.hubrise.com/).
- Go to **SETTINGS** > **DEVELOPER**, then click on **Create an OAuth 2.0 client**.
- Enter a name for your application, then click the **Create** button.

Download the client secret JSON, which should look like this:

```json
{
  "client_id": "459691768564.clients.hubrise.com",
  "client_secret": "c9ba1790673172ddcdee071c551d98dee4d0d6fc696c"
}
```

The client's **id** and **secret** are used to identify your application. You will generally need to create a single client for your application. The same client can be used by several HubRise accounts.

## Request the Account's Authorisation

In order for your application to access a HubRise account's information, you need the authorisation from the account's owner.

As the owner of your test HubRise account, you must authorise access to your own application.

Open a web browser with the following URL and make sure you replace `{{client_id}}` with the `client_id` you downloaded from the secret JSON:

```http
https://manager.hubrise.com/oauth2/v1/authorize?
  redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&
  client_id={{client_id}}&
  scope=location[orders.write,customer_list.write,catalog.read]
```

You will have the chance to review the connection details and to grant access permissions to your application.

If everything goes well, you should see a page similar to the following.
[comment]: # (I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GIVE THIS PAGE A NAME, AND INCLUDE THE SCREENSHOT BELOW)

![authorisation code](../images/001-en-generate-user-code.png)

This is the **authorisation code**. Copy it and head to the next section.
[comment]: # (STRANGE TO START BY "THIS IS AN...". AGAIN, I WOULD NOT ASSUME THE SCREENSHOT IS CONTENT. BETTER EXPLAIN IN WORDS WHAT WE SEE AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO.)

## Generate the Access Token

You now have three codes:

- The client id
- The client secret
- The authorisation code

With these, you can generate your access token with Postman.

An access token is how you authenticate the requests you send to HubRise.
Basically, you want your application (client id) to be authorised (via the client secret) to send requests to HubRise on behalf of the account owner (authorisation code), and you do this with the **Access Token**.

### Set up Variables in Postman

In Postman, select the **HubRise API** environment and enter the values for `client_id`, `client_secret` and `auth_code`.

### Send the Request

Select the **Generate Access Token** request and click the **Send** button.

Postman will send the following request to the API:

```json
POST https://manager.hubrise.com/oauth2/v1/token?code={{auth_code}}&client_id={{client_id}}&client_secret={{client_secret}}
```

If the request is successful, Postman will automatically populate the `X-Access-Token` variable in the environment, and this will be used as access token for all of the following requests.

## Create Your First Order

Now you are ready to send valid requests to HubRise and to create new orders.

In Postman, send the **Create Order** request. If the request is successful, you should see a new order in the [HubRise back office](https://manager.hubrise.com/orders).

Congratulations! You placed your first order on HubRise.

## Set up a Callback (Optional)

In many cases, your application will need to be notified when a certain event occurs, such as when an order is created or updated. This can be achieved with a callback.

As an optional step, you can set up a second application that listens to the events generated by the first application via a callback mechanism. To do this, you will first need to create a second OAuth client and obtain the access token, just as you did before.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: An application cannot receive callback notifications for events generated by itself!

---

### Obtain the Access Token

After creating the new client, head to the Postman collection and populate the `callback_client_id`, `callback_client_secret`, and `callback_auth_code` fields in the environment.

You can send the `Callback: Generate Access Token` request to obtain the access token. This will be automatically saved as a separate environment variable from the previous one, since you will need both.

### Obtain the Webhook URL

In order to register your callback, you need a valid URL that can listen to events. If you don't have your own server already, you might use the [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) service. When you visit the website, a unique URL will be created that you can use as your webhook URL.

This page will show all the events received by the callback.

### Register the Callback

Now that you have the callback URL, head back to Postman and copy the value in the `callback_url` field. Then, send the `Callback: Create Webhook` request.

A successful response means that you registered your callback URL correctly.

### Place an Order and Check the Webhook

Now you can try to place an order with your first application. You can use the same `Create Order` request you sent before. This time, however, you will see that the order is automatically forwarded to your webhook URL.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The event should appear almost immediately on the webhook.site page. If it fails to do so, check that the order was placed using your first application token.

---

### Get New Events without a Public URL

In some circumstances, a webhook cannot be set up because a callback URL cannot be exposed. This is typical for applications that users download and run from their computer.

In this case, you can set up a passive callback. Your application will then check for new events at regular intervals of time and perform the necessary operations when a new event is found.

The `Callback: Get Events` request in Postman is an example of how you can do that. Simply create a new order, as usual, and send this request right after to obtain the order's details.

After you process the event, you should delete it so that it will not appear in the next `GET /events` request.
Unlike active callbacks, events need to be manually deleted after being processed with a passive callback.

## Next Steps

### Install OrderLine

OrderLine is a simple, free application you can connect to your HubRise account to manage incoming orders. With OrderLine, you will be able to accept or reject incoming test orders and inspect the different logs from Postman.

To connect OrderLine to your HubRise location, click on **CONNECTIONS** > **View available apps**, then scroll down the list and select OrderLine.

### Experiment with the API

The Postman collection contains other typical requests to obtain the account's information, create and update customers, and update order statuses. Test the various endpoints according to your needs.

### From Postman to Code

Postman has a useful built-in functionality that allows to transform your test requests to actual code snippets in various languages. In this way, you will be able to transition from testing to integrating really quickly.
