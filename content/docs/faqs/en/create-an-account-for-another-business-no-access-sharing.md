If you are a software provider, a reseller or a consultant, you may wish to create an account for your customer on HubRise without sharing access to the HubRise back office. There could be several reasons for this. For instance, you may be offering HubRise as a white-label service, or your client may be paying for a full service and doesn't want or need access.

To create an account for another business without giving them access :

1. Log into your HubRise Account. To log in to HubRise, visit the [HubRise Login page](https://manager.hubrise.com/login) or the [HubRise home page](https://www.hubrise.com). Enter your company's HubRise User Profile and password on HubRise, then click **Login**.
1. Click your name in the top right corner of HubRise the back office, then click **Profile**.
1. In the **Permissions** section, click **Create Account**. For more information, see [Create an Account](/docs/account#create-an-account).
