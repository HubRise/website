When you switch from a free plan to a paid plan, an email and a notice on the HubRise page will request you to pay for your HubRise subscription.

To pay for your first invoice, you must register a payment method and manually pay for the invoice.

To verify your registered payment method or add a new one to your HubRise Account, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com/login).
1. Click on **SETTINGS**.
1. In the **Payment** section, review your payment method details. If there is no existing payment method, click **Add payment method**.
1. Enter your credit card details.
1. Click **Save**.

After you set up the payment method, you can manually pay for your first invoice. Follow these steps:

1. In your HubRise back office, click on **SETTINGS**.
2. In the **Requests for payment** section, review the details of the outstanding payment. You can see the description of the payment, the payment deadline, and the total amount due.
3. To pay your invoice, click on the <InlineImage width="17" height="17">![Cart icon](../../images/068-cart-icon.png)</InlineImage> cart icon under **PAY**.
