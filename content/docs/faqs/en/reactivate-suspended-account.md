An account is suspended if you do not pay for your HubRise subscription, or if your payment is unsuccessful.
A suspended account cannot receive orders and cannot communicate with the connected apps.

To reactivate a suspended account, you need to pay for the subscription, and then re-establish the service. Follow these steps:

1. If you do not have a registered payment method, enter your card details first:
   1. Log in to your [HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com/login).
   1. Click on **SETTINGS**.
   1. In the **Payment** section, click **Add payment method**.
   1. Enter your credit card details.
   1. Click **Save**.
1. In the **Requests for payment** section, review the details of the outstanding payment. You can see the description of the payment, the payment deadline, and the total amount due.
1. To pay your invoice, click on the <InlineImage width="17" height="17">![Cart icon](../../images/068-cart-icon.png)</InlineImage> cart icon under **PAY**.
1. Follow the instructions on screen to authorise the payment.
1. To reactivate your account, from the **Account** section, click **Re-establish the service immediately**.
