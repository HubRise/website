There are ways to manage these extra Accounts.

- Update the name of the Accounts to more easily differentiate them. For example, if you created Accounts to test connections, you might add **Test** to their name. For more information on renaming Accounts, see [Accounts](/docs/settings/#accounts).
- Removing your profile from an Account will prevent you from seeing it:
  - Register a HubRise user with a different email address.
  - Add that secondary user as an Admin for the Account. For information on creating user profiles, see [Permissions](/docs/settings/#permissions).
  - Remove your permission to the Account. For more information on removing a user from an Account, see [Permissions](/docs/settings/#permissions).
