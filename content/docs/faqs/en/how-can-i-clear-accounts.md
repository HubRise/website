There are different ways to manage accounts on HubRise.

- Update the name of the Accounts to more easily differentiate them. For example, if you created Accounts to test connections, you might add **Test** to their name. For more information on renaming Accounts, see [Modify Account Details](/docs/account#modify-account-details).
- Removing your profile from an Account will prevent you from seeing it. To do this remove your permission to the Account. For more information, see [Remove a User](/docs/permissions#remove-user).
- To delete the account, add **\_TO DELETE** to the account name and HubRise will delete it when purging the system.
