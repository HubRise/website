1. If there is no existing payment method, click **Add payment method**. Enter your credit card information. Credit cards must be valid to be accepted.
1. When finished, click **Save**.

Once you have your credit card saved, your plan will upgrade automatically exceed your current plan. To validate the first payment, it is recommended for you to upgrade the plan manually and enter your CVC code when prompted.

To upgrade manually:

1. Select **SETTINGS** > **ACCOUNTS**.
1. For users with multiple Accounts, select the Account containing the specific Location.

   - If the Location will use the same payment method as the Account, make sure that this is set to **Subscription is paid by the account**.
   - If the Location will use a different credit card, click **Make the location pay for it**. Then click **Add payment method** and enter your credit card method.
1. Under **Usage**, select **Change plan**.
1. To set your plan to use the paid plan that allows more transactions a month, click **Upgrade**.
1. When prompted, click **Pay** and add your CVC code to authorize the payment plan.
1. Repeat this process for each Location you want to upgrade.
