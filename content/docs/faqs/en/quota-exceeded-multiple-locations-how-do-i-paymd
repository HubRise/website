First, set your payment method:

1. Log in to HubRise through the [HubRise Login page](https://manager.hubrise.com/login).
2. Go to **SETTINGS** > **ACCOUNTS**.
3. Select the Account to update. Users that only have one Account will have that one selected by default.
4. If there is no existing payment method, click **Add payment method**. Enter your credit card information. Credit cards must be valid to be accepted.
5. When finished, click **Save**.

Once you have your credit card saved, your plan will upgrade automatically if you exceed your current plan. To validate the first payment, it is recommended for you to upgrade the plan manually and enter your CVC code when prompted.

To upgrade manually:

1. Select **SETTINGS** > **ACCOUNTS**.
2. For users with multiple Accounts, select the Account containing the specific Location.
3. Click the Location to update.
4. Scroll down to **Payment** and verify it is set to **Subscription is paid by the account**.
5. Under **Usage**, select **Change plan**.
6. To set your plan to use the paid plan that allows more transactions a month, click **Upgrade**.
7. When prompted, click **Pay** and add your CVC code to authorize the payment plan.
8. Repeat this process for each Location you want to upgrade.
