HubRise provides a free plan that includes a monthly usage quota. When a free plan has met this usage quota, the Account must be upgraded from the free plan to a paid plan. For more information on HubRise plan pricing, see the [HubRise pricing page](/pricing).

If the payment method is registered, the Account will upgrade to the paid plan when the free quota is exceeded. For more information on how to add a payment method on HubRise, see [Update a Payment Method](/docs/payment#add-a-payment-method).

If no payment method is registered when the free plan usage quota has been exceeded, Admin users for the Account or Location will receive an email and a notice on the HubRise back office informing them they must register a payment method and upgrade their plan.

If the payment method is not set within two weeks after the first email alert is sent, the Account will be suspended. To prevent such inconvenience, it is recommended to include a payment method as soon as HubRise is being used. The upgraded plan will not begin until your Account exceeds the free quota limitation, even if you have selected the upgraded tier level and set your payment method.

For more information, see [Usage](/docs/usage-plan/).
