HubRise provides a free plan that includes a monthly usage quota. When a free plan has met this usage quota, the Account must be upgraded from the free plan to a paid plan. For more information on HubRise plan pricing, see the [HubRise pricing page](/pricing).

If a payment method is registered, the Account is automatically upgraded to the paid plan when the free quota is exceeded. For more information on adding a payment method, see [Update a Payment Method](/docs/payment#add-a-payment-method).

If no payment method is registered when the free plan usage quota is exceeded, Admin users for the Account or Location receive an email and see a notice on the HubRise back office informing them they must register a payment method and upgrade their plan.

If you do not set a payment method within two weeks after the first email alert, the Account will be suspended. To prevent such inconvenience, you can include a payment method as soon as you start using HubRise. You will not be charged until your Account exceeds the free quota limit.

For more information, see [Usage](/docs/usage-plan/).
