There are a few different ways of verifying that the connection between your system or app to HubRise is working properly. The first step for all of these recommendations is to log in to HubRise through the [HubRise Login page](https://manager.hubrise.com/login).

### Check the Orders Coming In

If orders are being made in an connected app, they can be viewed in HubRise through the following process:

1. Click **DATA**, then **Orders**.
2. At the top of the page, select the **Account** and in **Location** choose either **All locations** or the specific location to view.
3. If transactions are coming through you will see them here. Orders are displayed in reverse chronological order.

For more details, see [Orders](/docs/data/#orders).

Each app displays the most recent activity as a graph. To check the activity for a specific app:

1. Click **CONNECTIONS**.
2. For the specific App, click **Actions > View activity**.
