There are many reasons for creating user profiles for other people:

- You want to grant your staff access to the HubRise Account.
- You provide software support for your customers, and want to create their user profiles to save them time.

To create a user profile for another person:

1. If you are already logged in to HubRise, log out.
2. Access the [HubRise registration page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup).
3. Enter the **name**, **email**, and **password** for the new user.
4. To prompt the user to enter their own secure password, go to the [password reset page](https://manager.hubrise.com/reset_password/new).
5. Enter the email address for the new user and click **Reset Password**. The user will receive an email with instructions on entering their own password.
6. Logout as the newly created user, then login as your actual user profile.
