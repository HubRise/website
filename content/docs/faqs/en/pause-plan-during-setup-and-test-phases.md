  title: Pause Plan Upgrade When Free Plan Quota Is Exceeded | HubRise
  description: HubRise provides a free plan with a limited quota generally sufficient for testing. If not, you can ask for HubRise to pause the plan while testing.

HubRise provides a free plan with a limited quota of orders and customers per month. This is sufficient in most cases when setting up or testing a connection. HubRise can suspend the plan upgrade under these conditions:

- You are a developer or a reseller and need a test Account.
- You have an Account on HubRise and need to run extensive testing before going live with connections.

If you meet one of these criterias, contact support@hubrise.com to request a momentarily exception to the payment policy explaining your particular situation and specifying a realistic date.
