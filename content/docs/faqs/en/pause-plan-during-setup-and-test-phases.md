HubRise provides a free plan with a limited quota of orders and customers per month. This is sufficient in most cases when setting up or testing a connection. Plans may be suspended if under these conditions:

- You are a developer or a reseller and need a test Account.
- You have an Account on HubRise and need to run extensive testing before going live with connections.

If you meet one of these criterias, contact [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com) to request a momentarily exception to the payment policy explaining your particular situation and specifying a realistic date.
