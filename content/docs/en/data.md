## Catalogs {#catalogs}

From the **CATALOGS** page, you can view the catalogs pushed into HubRise and the logs of the requests that made changes to the catalog.

Connected apps that have access to your HubRise catalog can pull its product list or push new products into it. For example, a connected EPOS can push its catalog into HubRise for an e-commerce website to use it. If required, you can also edit the catalog using **Catalog Manager**, a free app available on HubRise. For more information, see [Catalog Manager](/apps/catalog-manager/overview).

### View Catalog {#view-catalog}

Accounts and Locations can contain multiple Catalogs. To view a specific Catalog, select it from the dropdown list next to the title **Catalogs**.

Catalogs are presented in three tabs:

- **SKUS**: The items that you sell to the customers.
- **DEALS**: The deals available in the catalog.
  A deal provides a price reduction on combinations of Products bought together. For instance, **Buy One Get One Free** is a deal that applies to two Products. It applies to two Products and provides a price reduction equal to the price of the cheapest Product.
- **DISCOUNTS**: The discounts available in the catalog.
  Discount codes apply savings to the overall order rather than specific products. For example, **FREEDELIVERY** might remove the delivery fee for the entire order, or **FRIYAY** might provide a 10% discount to the entire order on Friday.

For SKUs, you can see the following attributes:

- **CATEGORY**: The category for the product, for example _Boots_.
- **PRODUCT**: The name displayed to the customer. Product names do not need to be unique. For example, you may sell shoes of different sizes, but with the same product name _Waterproof boots_.
- **SKU**: The SKU or product size. For example, in the case of _Waterproof boots_, you might sell a SKU with size 28 and black colour, and another SKU with size 32 and brown colour.
- **PRICE**: The price of the product, and the currency used.
- **REF CODE**: The unique identifier of the product from the source product management system. This identifies the item across all apps. Identifiers are alphanumeric with special characters. For example, `boots_waterproof_size_28_black` can refer to a pair of boots with size 28 and black colour.

For Deals and Discounts, you can see the following attributes:

- **NAME**: The Deal or Discount name.
- **REF CODE**: The unique identifier of the Deal or Discount from the source product management system.

To see the full logs of all the requests that make changes to the catalog, click **View logs**. For more information, see [Logs](/docs/data#logs).

## Logs {#logs}

Each page in the **DATA** section provides more information through its log page.

Logs record the requests from an app to HubRise. Each request is a transaction between an app and HubRise, such as an order, a new customer registered, or a catalog update.

The log page displays a summary list of requests in reverse chronological order. When you open an order in the **ORDERS** page, select a log on the **CUSTOMERS** page or click on **View logs** on the **CATALOGS** page, the following information is displayed:

- **TIME (UTC+02:00)**: The date and time of the request, in UTC format.
- **ORIGIN**: The app that created the request.
- **ENDPOINT**: The endpoint of the request, including HTTP method and URL path.
- **RESPONSE**: The HTTP response code.

Further log details are available for advanced users and developers to view app communications and troubleshoot issues. To view details for a log entry:

1. Click the row to display. A full list of the query and response will be displayed.
1. To download either the query or response, select the download icon <InlineImage width="15" height="14">![Download icon](../images/058-download.png)</InlineImage>. The selected query or response will be provided as a JSON file.
