## Catalogs

The **DATA** > **CATALOGS** page displays the products offered in the selected Catalog. Updating your product list and importing them into HubRise is performed by the connected app from which your catalog is managed. For example, a connected EPOS would manage its catalog and transmit its information to HubRise.

From the Catalogs page, you can view the catalogs imported into HubRise and the logs of request effecting the catalog.

### View Catalog

The Catalog displayed is set by the Account and Location selected at the top of the page. For more information on setting the Account to display, see [Accounts and Locations](/docs/getting-started/#accounts-and-locations).

Accounts and Locations can contain multiple Catalogs. To display the specific Catalog, select it from the dropdown list next to the title **Catalogs**.

Catalogs are presented in three tabs:

- **PRODUCTS**: The item being sold to the customer.
- **DEALS**: A deal provides a price reduction on either an Order Product or Products. For instance, **Buy One Get One Free** is a deal that applies to two Products. It applies to two Products to provide a price reduction equal to the price of the cheapest Product.
- **DISCOUNTS**: Discount codes apply savings to the overall order rather than specific products. For example, **FREEDELIVERY** to remove the delivery fee for the entire order, or **FRIYAY** would provide a 10% discount to the entire order on Friday.

Depending on which tab is selected, the following attributes are available:

- **REFERENCE**: The unique identifier of the product or deal from the source product management system. This identifies the item across all apps. Identifiers are alphanumeric with special characters. For example `sparkling_mineral_water_75_c` may refer to a bottle of sparkling water of a specific size.
- **PRODUCT**: The name displayed to the customer. These names do not need to be unique. For example, you may sell shoes of different sizes with the product references `boots_waterproof_size_28` and `boots_waterproof_size_30`, with the product name for both as Waterproof boots.
- **CATEGORY**: The product category for the product, such as Snacks, Shirts, Boots, etc.
- **VARIANT**: The SKU or product size. For example, the product reference may be `boots_waterproof_size_28_black`, with the name Waterproof boots, and the variant as Size 28 and black colour. Another set of boots may have the reference `boots_waterproof_size_32_brown the name`, with the name Waterproof boots, and the variant as Size 32 and brown colour.
- **PRICE**: The price of the product, and the currency used.

To see full log file details of all requests effecting catalogs, click View logs. For more information see [Logs](/docs/#logs).

## Logs

Each subsection in **DATA** provides more information through their log page.

Logs record the requests from an app to HubRise. Each request is a transaction between an app and HubRise. It could be an order, a new customer registered, or any other communication between an app and HubRise.

The log page displays a summary list of requests in reverse chronological order. When you open an order in the **ORDERS** page or select **View logs** on **CUSTOMERS** or **CATALOGS** pages, the following information is displayed:

- **DATE**: The date and time of the request.
- **CLIENT NAME**: The source of the request.
- **METHOD**: The HTTP method used in communicating the request.
- **PATH**: The URL path for the update.
- **CODE**: The HTTP response.

Further log details are available for advanced users and developers to view app communications and troubleshoot issues. To view details for a log entry:

1. Click the row to display. A full list of the query and response will be displayed.

2. To download either the query or response, select the download icon <InlineImage width="15" height="14">![Download icon](../images/058-download.png)</InlineImage>. The selected query or response will be provided as a JSON file.

For more information, see [Understanding Logs in HubRise](/docs/understanding-logs). For a complete reference on the HubRise API, see the [HubRise API Reference page](/developers/api/general-concepts).
