The **Customer lists** section in the **SETTINGS** page allows you to add, edit, and delete customer lists.

Customer Lists can be added to Accounts and Locations with the following conditions:

- By default, Accounts define one Customer list named after the Account. Locations do not have a Customer list defined by default.
- An Account must have at least one Customer list. If you attempt to delete the last Customer list of an Account, an error notification will be displayed.
- You can create as many Customer lists as you need. For example:
  - You can create a test Customer list to be used without impacting production.
  - You can create a Customer list for a Location that have different Customers than other Locations.

You can connect integrated apps to a specific customer list. Your customers are registered, managed and imported from your third party application into HubRise, and cannot be edited from the HubRise interface.

Adding or editing a customer list does not affect third party applications.

## Add a Customer List

To add a customer list, follow these steps:

1. Select **SETTINGS**.
1. To add the Customer list at Account level, verify that **All locations** is selected. To add it to a Location, select the Location from the **Location** dropdown.
1. From the **Customer lists** section, click **Add a customer list**.
1. Enter the name for the customer list. If you only have one customer list, we recommend using your Account or Location name.
1. Click **Create** to save the new list.

## Customer List Details

The **Customer lists** section displays the following information:

- **Name**: The name of the customer list, followed by its unique identifier. This unique identifier does not change even if the name of the customer list is changed. For example: The customer list `Baker Street` would be displayed as `Baker Street - abc123`. If the catalog `Baker Street` is renamed to `Dunning Street`, it will be displayed as `Dunning Street - abc123`.
- **Customer Count**: The number of customers imported into HubRise. To view customer list details, see [Customers](/docs/data/#customers).

To view the details of a customer list, click the name of the list. It will automatically link you to the **DATA** > **Customers** page for the specific list.
