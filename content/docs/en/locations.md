As described in [Accounts and Locations](/docs/terminology/#accounts-and-locations), Locations are the different points of sales for an Account. Locations are displayed with:

- The Location name
- The unique identifier for the Account they are associated with.
- The number indicating in what order the Location was added (starting at zero).

For example, **Baker Street z6q31-0** indicates the Location name of **Baker Street**, that it belongs to Account **z6q31**, and **-0** signifies it was the first Location added to this Account.

## Location Settings

To view Location details:

1. Go to **SETTINGS**.
1. If you have multiple Accounts, select the Account for the Location
1. In the **Locations** section, click on the Location's name.

Locations are managed in the same way as Accounts, but the information is specific to the selected Location.

Different settings for specific locations allow you to have different payment methods per location, different users [permissions](/docs/permissions), and so on. For more information, see [Accounts](/docs/account/).

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Depending on your business, the Location may have a different VAT number than the Account. Verify that all VAT numbers are correctly configured on all Accounts and Locations you manage.
