## Accounts and Locations

Most users have one Account with one or more locations to manage. You may also have multiple Accounts, each with multiple Locations to manage.

An **Account** identifies your brand. **Locations** refers to the point of sales within this brand, typically physical outlets, but can also refer to online stores separate from the physical locations.

Accounts can have one or more locations. A small business may have one Account with one Location, while a larger business may have one Account with multiple Locations tied to the same Account.

Accounts are named after the brand, while Locations are named after the city or physical outlet. For example, the brand **Fast Pizza** might have the multiple locations in London named after their street address **Baker Street**, **Dublin Street**, and **Duncannon Street**. Another brand **Best Borscht** might only have one location in London.

Once connected, users with a single Account will have that one selected by default. For users with multiple Accounts, you can select the Account to display during your HubRise session. If you want to get an overall view of an Account’s performance, select all Locations. If you want to narrow results to one Location within an Account, select the Account then the corresponding Location.

- For users with multiple Accounts, click the down arrow <InlineImage width="28" height="21">![Down arrow icon](../images/063-arrow.jpg)</InlineImage> next to **Account** and select the Account to display.
- To display data on all Locations or for a specific Location, click the down arrow <InlineImage width="28" height="21">![Down arrow icon](../images/063-arrow.jpg)</InlineImage> next to **Location** and select either **All locations** or the specific location.
