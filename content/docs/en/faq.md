## What Happens If My Free Plan Quota Is Exceeded?

HubRise provides a free plan that includes a monthly usage quota. When a free plan has met this usage quota, the Account must be upgraded from the free plan to a paid plan. For more information on HubRise plan pricing, see the [HubRise pricing page](/pricing).

If the payment method is registered, the Account will be automatically upgraded when the free quota is exceeded.

When the free plan usage quota has been exceeded, admin users for the Account or Location will receive an email and a notice on the HubRise page informing them they must register a payment method and upgrade their plan.

If the payment method is not set two weeks after the first email alert is sent, the Account will be suspended.

If you know that you will have more transactions than the current plan provides, you can upgrade the plan before being notified. The upgraded plan will not begin until your Account exceeds the free quota limitation, even if you have selected the upgraded tier level and set your payment method.

More information is available at [Usage](/docs/settings/#usage).

## Can My Plan Be Paused During Setup and Test Phase?

HubRise provides a free plan with a limited quota of orders and customers per month. This is sufficient in most cases when setting up or testing a connection. Plans may be suspended if under these conditions:

- You are a developer or a reseller and need a test Account.
- You have an Account on HubRise and need to run extensive testing before going live with connections.

If you meet one of these criterias, contact [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com) to request a momentarily exception to the payment policy explaining your particular situation and specifying a realistic date.

## Too Many Accounts Were Created for My Business. How Can I Clear the System?

## There are ways to manage these extra Accounts.

- Update the name of the Accounts to more easily differentiate them. For example, if you created Accounts to test connections, you might add **Test** to their name. For more information on renaming Accounts, see [Accounts](/docs/settings/#accounts).
- Removing your profile from an Account will prevent you from seeing it:
  - Register a HubRise user with a different email address.
  - Add that secondary user as an Admin for the Account. For information on creating user profiles, see [Permissions](/docs/settings/#permissions).
  - Remove your permission to the Account. For more information on removing a user from an Account, see [Permissions](/docs/settings/#permissions).

## How Do I know If I have a User profile in HubRise?

The easiest way to see if you have a user profile in HubRise is by using the [Lost your password page](https://manager.hubrise.com/reset_password/new). Enter your email address and click **Reset Password**. If you have a user profile, an email will be sent instructing you on how to complete the password reset process.

If you do not have a HubRise user profile, a message will be displayed indicating that the email address is not registered. To create a new profile, use the [HubRise Registration page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup).

Enter the email address associated with your HubRise user profile, and click **Reset Password**. You will receive an email with instructions on how to reset your password. Once complete, you will be able to log in to your HubRise user profile again.
