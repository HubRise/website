## View Connection Logs

Logs are stored for each app that has been connected. These logs are used to understand the communications between systems and detect issues. To view logs for a connection, select **CONNECTIONS** > **Action** > **View logs** for the specific app.

Logs record the requests from an app to HubRise. Each request is a transaction between an app and HubRise. It could be an order, a new customer registered, or any other communication between an app and HubRise.

### General information

- **Scope**: The connection permissions, such as whether the connection can access the Account or a single Location, what read/write access it has on the data, etc.
- **Customer list** and **Catalog**: Depending on the Scope, additional lines can display the ID for the resources that have been granted access to, such as the customer list and the catalog.
