In the **SETTINGS** > **Usage** section you can see the number of orders and customers that have been processed through HubRise in the current [billing cycle](/docs/payment#billing-cycles). It also shows the HubRise subscription fee related to each of the Locations on your Account.

## View Usage

To view Usage details for an Account or Location: 
1. Go to **SETTINGS**.
1. For users with access to multiple Accounts, select the Account from the **Account** dropdown.  
1. Select **All locations**. The **Usage** section shows the usage information for all Locations for which the HubRise subscription is paid at Account level.
1. Select the specific Location using the **Location** dropdown to see Locations for which the HubRise subscription is paid at the Location level. 

----

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: You will not necessarily see all Locations in the **Usage** section if **All locations** is selected. If a location is missing from this list, select the missing location from the **Location** dropdown. It means the subscription [payment](/docs/payment) is set at Location level.

## Usage Plans

HubRise provides both free and paid plans for its services. For complete information on plans and pricing, see the [HubRise Price page](/pricing/).

Free plans are available for Locations with a limited number of transactions a month. Once this limit is reached, you must upgrade to the paid tier to continue service. When the free plan limit is reached, all Admin users for the Account and the specific Location will be notified via email.

If you know that you will have more than the free plan quota allows, you can set the plan to the paid tier before being notified. The plan will not begin until the free quota limit is surpassed, even if you have selected the paid tier level and set your payment method.

It is possible to contact HubRise at [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com) and request a free plan during the test phase prior to launch.

## Plan Notifications

When there is an issue with a plan, Users with Admin permission to the Account or the related Location will receive an email. A notification will also display when they log in to HubRise. You might see notifications in the HubRise back office for any reason involving payments or plan issues, such as:

- A Location has exceeded its free transactions limits and no payment method was saved in HubRise.
- The credit card has expired and you need to update it.
- The credit card cannot be processed after a couple of automated payment attempts. For safety reasons, your bank might require you to enter the 3-digit security code again.
- The credit card has been saved in HubRise for payments but outstanding quotes have not been paid. For more information, see [Process Pending Quotes](/docs/payment/#process-pending-quotes).

If a payment notification appears, click the link and follow the instructions to resolve the issue. For more information on available plans, see [Usage Plans](#usage-plans).

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: If there is a problem with your payment method, Admin users will receive an email notification and a message will display in the HubRise back office. Failing a response after two weeks, the HubRise Account, or the related Location will be automatically suspended.

## Change Plan

You can change your plan to best meet your needs and the traffic of your business at any time without being over charged. For more details, see [Usage Plans](#usage-plans).

To change your plan for a Location, follow these steps:

1. Select **SETTINGS**.
1. For users with access to multiple Accounts, select the Account containing the specific Location.
1. Select the Location from the **Location** dropdown.
1. Under **Usage**, select **Change plan**.
1. To set your plan to use the paid plan that allows more transactions a month, click **Upgrade**. To change the plan to one that allows fewer orders and customers a month, click **Downgrade**. Once you have reached the transaction limit for a free plan, the plan will automatically upgrade to the paid plan again.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: To upgrade, you must have a payment method setup. For information, see [Add a Payment Method](/docs/payment/#add-a-payment-method). Your Account will not be charged until you exceed the free monthly limitation.
