## Create an Account

When you log in to HubRise for the first time, you will be asked to create an Account and a Location.
A HubRise Account identifies your brand, while a Location refers to the point of sales within this brand, typically the physical outlet.

- The **Account Name** is the name of your business or brand, for example `Fast Pizza`.
- The **Location Name** identifies your physical outlet, and could be the city, the area, or the street name. For example, if the location is the only one in London, the Location name could be `London`. If you have multiple locations in London, you could name them after their street address, for example `Baker Street`, `Dublin Street`, and `Duncannon Street`.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Make sure you select the correct **Currency** from the dropdown menu, as you will not be able to change it later.

A small business will have one Account with one Location, while a larger business will have one Account with multiple Locations. For more information, see [Accounts](/docs/account/) and [Locations](/docs/locations/).

A User Profile can have access to multiple Accounts. On the other hand, different User Profiles can have access to the same Account with different permission levels. For more information, see [Permissions](/docs/permissions/).
