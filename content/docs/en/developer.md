The **SETTINGS** > **DEVELOPER** section is provided for you to create your own integrations into the HubRise ecosystem. It could be an app you have created, or a third party solution you customised to your needs that requires transactional data available in HubRise.

For more information, see [HubRise Developer page](/developers) or contact HubRise at [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com).

The HubRise API is public; anyone is welcome to integrate.
