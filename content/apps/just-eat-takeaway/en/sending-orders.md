  description: Find out the technical details of how orders are sent from Just Eat Takeaway to HubRise, which fields are passed and which are not.
---

Connecting Just Eat Takeaway to HubRise allows you to receive orders directly in your EPOS.
This page describes the information that HubRise receives from Just Eat Takeaway for your orders.

## Items and Options

Just Eat Takeaway orders contain the complete information about items and options, including name, POS ref code, quantity, and price. Deals, however, are not supported.

## Order Statuses

When an order status changes on HubRise, Just Eat Takeaway Bridge notifies Just Eat, and the change can be seen by the customer.

As a minimum requirement, Just Eat Takeaway expects every successful order to be marked as "confirmed".
From the configuration page of Just Eat Takeaway Bridge, you can customise when the confirmation is sent to the platform. The following are the three possible scenarios:

- `Mark the order as Confirmed when it is sent to HubRise`: New orders are automatically confirmed on Just Eat Takeaway as soon as HubRise receives them.
- `Mark the order as Confirmed when HubRise status changes to "Received"`: Orders are confirmed on Just Eat Takeaway only when the HubRise status changes to `received`.
- `Mark the order as Confirmed when HubRise status changes to "Accepted"`: Orders are confirmed on Just Eat Takeaway only when the HubRise status changes to `accepted`. Only in this case, marking an order as `received` on HubRise informs the platform that the order has been received, but not yet confirmed.

## Service Types

Just Eat Takeaway supports three service types:

- Delivery by Just Eat Takeaway riders
- Delivery by the restaurant's fleet
- Customer collection

These are typically associated with specific ref codes in your EPOS, which you can set in the Configuration page of the Bridge. For more information about ref codes, see your EPOS documentation in our [apps page](/apps).

## Customer Details

Full customer's details are provided by Just Eat Takeaway for all orders, regardless of the service type. 
Email address is never provided by Just Eat Takeaway, so this field is always missing on HubRise.

## Discounts and Charges

In the order, you can find information about Just Eat Takeaway discounts and delivery charges, if present.

## Technical Reference

This section describes how orders are encoded in the JSON payloads you receive from Just Eat Takeaway Bridge.

### Just Eat Takeaway Order ID

When a new order is created on HubRise, the Just Eat Takeaway order ID is stored in the `collection_code` field. 
This is the order reference ID that the customer sees on the platform.

### Supported Order Statuses

Just Eat Takeaway Bridge creates new orders with status `new`.

The following status updates automatically trigger a request from Just Eat Takeaway Bridge to the platform:

- `in_preparation`: The order is being prepared in the kitchen.               
- `in_delivery`: The order is out for delivery.                             
- `completed`: The order has been collected or delivered.                               
- `rejected`, `cancelled`, `delivery_failed`: There was a problem with the order. The request body contains information about the error. 

Other HubRise status updates are not supported and do not trigger any request to Just Eat Takeaway.

### Items

For every item in the order, Just Eat Takeaway Bridge provides the following information:

- `sku_ref`: The ref code of the item
- `product_name`: The product name
- `price`: The price for a single item
- `quantity`: The quantity of items included in the order

- `price`: The price for a single item

Every option has single quantity. Multiple identical options are encoded in separate option objects.
