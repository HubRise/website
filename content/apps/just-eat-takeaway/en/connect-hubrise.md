Connecting Just Eat Takeaway to HubRise can be done with a few steps.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you do not have a HubRise account yet, register on our [Signup Page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup). It only takes a minute!

## 1. Enable HubRise on Just Eat Takeaway

As a first step, the Just Eat Takeaway support must activate the HubRise integration for your stores.

Contact us at support@hubrise.com and include the following information in your email:

- The URL link to your restaurant page on the Just Eat website. For example: https://www.just-eat.ie/restaurants-saba-to-go-rathmines/.
- Whether your Just Eat store is already connected to another middleware or EPOS.
- Your HubRise location name and identifier. For example: `Fast Pizza Baker Street z6q31-0`.

With this information in hand, we will ask Just Eat Takeaway support to enable the HubRise connection for your store and provide the Just Eat Takeaway ID, for example: `8736550`.

## 2. Add Products Ref Codes in Just Eat

Most apps require products ref codes to process orders correctly. You can either enter products ref codes manually in the Just Eat Takeaway back office, or ask their support team to enter them for you.

For more information, see [Map Ref Codes](/apps/just-eat-takeaway/map-ref-codes).
