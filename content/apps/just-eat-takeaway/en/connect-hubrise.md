Connecting Just Eat Takeaway to HubRise can be done with a few steps.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you don't already have a HubRise account, start by registering on the [HubRise Signup Page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup). It only takes a minute!

---

## 1. Enable HubRise on Just Eat Takeaway

As a first step, you need to contact your Just Eat Takeaway support and ask them to activate the API integration for your stores. Include [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com) and your Just Eat account manager in the email recipients. Alternatively, HubRise can send the request on your behalf.

You can use this email template and replace the sections in bold:

> Hi,
>
> Please activate the API integration for my restaurant:
>
> - URL of my restaurant: **include link to your store on the Just Eat website, for example: `https://www.just-eat.ch/en/menu/blaqk-2`**
> - Restaurant ExtID: use my Just Eat Takeaway ID
> - API workflow to activate: POSAPI
> - POS system to connect: HubRise
> - Type of connection: Primary
> - HubRise location: **include name and identifier, for example: `Fast Pizza Baker Street z6q31-0`**
>
> We also need access to the Just Eat Takeaway back office to enter product ref codes autonomously.
>
> Kindly provide the Just Eat Takeaway ID so that we can finalise the connection with HubRise.
>
> Best,

Just Eat Takeaway will enable the HubRise integration for your store and provide you with a Just Eat Takeaway ID, for example: `8736550`. You need this ID to connect Just Eat Takeaway Bridge to HubRise.

## 2. Map Products Ref Codes

Most apps require products ref codes to process orders correctly. You can either enter products ref codes manually in the Just Eat Takeaway back office, or ask their support team to enter them for you.

For more information, see [Map Ref Codes](/apps/just-eat-takeaway/map-ref-codes).
