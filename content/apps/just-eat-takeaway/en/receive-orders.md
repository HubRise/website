---

Connecting Just Eat Takeaway to HubRise allows you to receive orders directly in your EPOS. This page describes the information that HubRise receives from Just Eat Takeaway for your orders.

## Items and Options

Just Eat Takeaway orders contain the complete information about items and options, including name, POS ref code, quantity, and price. Deals, however, are not supported.

## Order Statuses

A Just Eat order goes through several statuses during its lifecycle:

- `Confirmed`: The order was confirmed.
- `Error`: There was an error. A Just Eat Takeaway agent calls the restaurant.
- `Kitchen`: The restaurant started preparing the order.
- `In Delivery`: The order is in delivery.
- `Delivered`: The order has been delivered.

As a minimum requirement, Just Eat Takeaway expects every successful order to be marked as `Confirmed`.

### Change the Status of an Order in Just Eat Takeaway

When an order status changes on HubRise, Just Eat Takeaway Bridge notifies Just Eat Takeaway. The correspondence between HubRise and Just Eat Takeaway statuses is as follows:

| HubRise status                               | Just Eat Takeaway status                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `new`, `received` or `accepted`              | You can configure which one of these statuses makes the order `Confirmed`. |
| `rejected`, `cancelled` or `delivery_failed` | `Error`                                                                    |
| `in_preparation`                             | `Kitchen`                                                                  |
| `in_delivery`                                | `In Delivery`                                                              |
| `completed`                                  | `Delivered`                                                                |

Just Eat Takeaway Bridge lets you decide which HubRise status triggers the `Confirmed` status. This is useful to handle different scenarios when your EPOS updates the order status. For example, if your EPOS marks an accepted order as `received` on HubRise, you can still notify Just Eat Takeaway that the order has been confirmed.

Other HubRise status values are not supported and are not sent on Just Eat Takeaway.

### Change the Status of an Order in HubRise

Just Eat Takeaway Bridge does not change order statuses in HubRise.

## Service Types

Just Eat Takeaway supports three service types:

- Delivery by Just Eat Takeaway riders
- Delivery by the restaurant's fleet
- Customer collection

These are typically associated with specific ref codes in your EPOS, which you can set in the Configuration page of the Bridge. For more information about ref codes, see your EPOS documentation in our [apps page](/apps).

## Customer Details

Full customer's details are provided by Just Eat Takeaway for all orders, regardless of the service type.
Email address is never provided by Just Eat Takeaway, so this field is always missing on HubRise.

## Discounts and Charges

In the order, you can find information about Just Eat Takeaway discounts and delivery charges, if present.

## Technical Reference
