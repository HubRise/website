  description: This page explains what are primary and secondary connections on Just Eat Takeaway, and how to solve possible issues that arise from a wrong configuration.

Just Eat Takeaway can enable multiple connections to your store.
For example, you can receive orders on your T-Connect Terminal and HubRise at the same time.

By default, T-Connect is the primary connection.
When you connect your store to HubRise, HubRise is set as your primary connection, while T-Connect is moved to second. 
To be able to receive your orders on your connected EPOS, HubRise must be your **primary** connection.

If you have issues receiving orders on HubRise, Just Eat Takeaway might decide to switch back T-Connect as your primary connection.
This ensures that you can still receive orders on your T-Connect device during the outage.
After the issue is resolved, if you want to continue to receive orders on HubRise, ensure that HubRise is again your primary connection by contacting your Just Eat Takeaway account manager.
