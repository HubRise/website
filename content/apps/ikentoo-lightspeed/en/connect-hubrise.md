  title: Connect to HubRise - iKentoo by Lightspeed
  description: See how to connect your iKentoo EPOS to HubRise to receive orders from all your connected apps. Connection is simple.
---

## Prerequisites

To establish the connection, iKentoo Bridge requires:

- iKentoo / Lightspeed Restaurant K-Series EPOS.
- The "iKentoo by Lightspeed" application installed on your iPad.
- A HubRise account set up with the locations to connect. For more information about accounts and locations, see the [HubRise User Guide](/docs).

Before you connect to HubRise, you need to send an email to [Lightspeed support](mailto:k-series.support@lightspeedhq.com) and ask to enable the integration. Without this, the API is by default not activated and the connection with HubRise will not work.

## Connection

iKentoo Bridge connects to a HubRise location. You must repeat the process below for each location you want to connect.

1. Open your HubRise back office and click the down arrow <InlineImage width="28" height="21">![Down arrow icon](../images/001-arrow.jpg)</InlineImage> next to **Location** to select the location you want to connect.

6. You will be redirected to the iKentoo Bridge user interface. Click **Connect to iKentoo** button.

7. The first time you connect, you will be redirected to iKentoo login page. Specify your iKentoo **Email** and **Password** and click **LOGIN**.

   - In the **Business location** dropdown, select the iKentoo business location to connect.
