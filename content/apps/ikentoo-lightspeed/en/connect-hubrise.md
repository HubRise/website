## Enable the HubRise integration

Before you connect to HubRise, contact Lightspeed support on [k-series.support@lightspeedhq.com](mailto:k-series.support@lightspeedhq.com) and ask them to enable the integration with HubRise. Data will not flow from HubRise to Lightspeed K Series until they activate the API.

## Connect iKentoo Bridge
