  description: Integrating iKentoo with food ordering platforms requires you to specify particular ref codes in the configuration page of the delivery platform bridge.
---

To connect iKentoo to Deliveroo, Uber Eats, or Just Eat, use the configuration parameters provided below.

By convention, Lightspeed support team uses these predefined codes when they set up the integration. If you configure the iKentoo back office autonomously, we recommend that you use the same codes, as this simplifies troubleshooting.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** These codes must be present in your iKentoo back office and must be included in the configuration page of the food platform bridge.

---

For detailed instructions on how to create ref codes in the iKentoo back office, see [Creating Ref Codes for Delivery Platforms](/apps/ikentoo-lightspeed/map-ref-codes/#creating-ref-codes-for-delivery-platforms).
