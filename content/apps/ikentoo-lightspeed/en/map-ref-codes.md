## Menu Setup

iKentoo Bridge is a _push-only_ integration. For this reason, menu items must be manually set in the system to connect with their corresponding ref codes to ensure a smooth communication between HubRise and iKentoo.

### Finding ref codes

To find ref codes for specific items:

- From your iKentoo back office, navigate to **Configuration** > **Items**.
- The ref codes are in the **Code** column:
