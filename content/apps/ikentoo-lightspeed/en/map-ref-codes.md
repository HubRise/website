## Menu Setup

iKentoo Bridge is a _push-only_ integration. For this reason, menu items must be manually set in the system to connect with their corresponding ref codes to ensure a smooth communication between HubRise and iKentoo.

### Finding ref codes

To find ref codes in the iKentoo back-office:

- Open the **Items** page from the **Configuration** Menu.
- The ref codes to copy are in the **Code** column:

### iKentoo Menu Export

The previous section showed you how to find ref codes for each menu item. You may also find useful to export the whole catalog.

- Open the **Items** page from the **Configuration** Menu.
- Click on the **Export** button:

- In the popup window, choose your operation system type: Mac or Windows (or Manual configuration) and click **Export**.
- After the export is complete, click on **Click here to download the exported file** to download the CSV file with your menu.
