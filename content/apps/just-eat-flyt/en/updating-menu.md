  description: Find out how to publish your menu to the Just Eat platform, how items and options are encoded, and which features are supported.

Just Eat does not provide a back office to populate and customise the items in your menu. 
You can use Just Eat Flyt Bridge to push your HubRise catalog directly to your Just Eat store with a single click.

This page explains how you can push and update your menu on Just Eat, and what information about HubRise catalogs can be pushed to the platform.

## Creating a HubRise Catalog

To be able to push your menu to Just Eat, you should create a HubRise catalog first. Many apps connected with HubRise, including EPOS solutions, offer the ability to export the menu to HubRise. Refer to your connected EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to verify.

For more information on HubRise catalogs, see [Catalogs](/docs/catalog/).

## Pushing the Menu From the Configuration Page

Once your catalog is present on HubRise, you can publish it on your Just Eat store by following these steps.

1. Log in to your HubRise account.
1. Select the location connected with your Just Eat store.
1. Select **Just Eat Flyt Bridge** from the list of connected apps.
1. From the Just Eat Flyt Bridge operations page, click the arrow <InlineImage width="20" height="20">![Arrow icon](../images/arrow-icon.jpg)</InlineImage> at the top right corner of the page to expand the menu, then click **Configuration**.
1. On the configuration page, from the **Actions** section at the bottom of the page, select **Publish menu on the platform**.

## Menu Encoding

The following sections describe in detail how HubRise catalogs are mapped to Just Eat menus.

### Categories

The categories in a HubRise catalog are mapped one-to-one to categories of products on Just Eat. 
The order in which categories and products appear on HubRise is maintained on Just Eat.

For every category, the following HubRise fields are pushed to Just Eat:
- `name`: The name of the category
- `description`: The description of the category

### Items Encoding

Products in the `products` array of a HubRise catalog can have several skus. This notion of products/skus is not supported on Just Eat. Every sku is mapped to an individual product on Just Eat. For more information about products in HubRise catalogs, see [Products](/developers/api/catalog-management/#products).

For every `sku` object in a product, Just Eat Flyt Bridge pushes the following information to Just Eat:

- `ref`: The ref of the sku, which will be passed along in orders         
- `name`: The name of the sku             
- `description`: The description of the parent product    
- `price`: The price of the sku            
- `option_list_refs`: The list of options attached to the sku
- image: The URL of the image of the parent product

For more information about skus in the HubRise catalog, see [Skus](/developers/api/catalog-management/#skus).

### Options Encoding

For every option list in the catalog, Just Eat Flyt Bridge pushes the following information to Just Eat:

- `name`: The name of the option list
- `type`: The number of options that can be selected from the list, either `single` or `multiple`.

For every option in an option list, the following information is sent to Just Eat:

- `ref`: The ref code of the option
- `name`: The option name
- `price`: The price for a single option

### Deals and Discounts

Deals and discounts are not supported on Just Eat. Therefore, deals and discounts present in your HubRise catalog are ignored and are not pushed to Just Eat.

### Availability

From the configuration page of Just Eat Flyt Bridge, you can select the availability for your menu.

You can choose to make your products available for delivery, collection, or both.

You can also set the opening and closing times of your store for each day of the week. Customers will not be able to order from your Just Eat store outside of these time windows.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: By default, closing times for delivery will be set half an hour earlier on the Just Eat store than the value you set on Just Eat Flyt Bridge. Closing times for collection, instead, are not modified.
