Connecting Just Eat to HubRise can be done with a few simple steps.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you don't already have a HubRise account, start by registering on the [HubRise Signup Page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup). It only takes a minute!

## 1. Enable the API integration

As a first step, you need to contact your Just Eat account manager and ask them to activate the Flyt API for your stores.
Include [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com) in the email recipients and add the following information in your email:

- The URL link of the Just Eat store you wish to connect. For example: [https://www.just-eat.ie/restaurants-saba-to-go-rathmines/](https://www.just-eat.ie/restaurants-saba-to-go-rathmines/).
- Your HubRise location name and identifier. For example: `Fast Pizza Baker Street z6q31-0`.

With this information in hand, Flyt integration team will enable the HubRise integration for your store and provide you with the required credentials to connect.
