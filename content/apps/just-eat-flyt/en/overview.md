## Description

Just Eat is an online delivery platform for restaurants and convenience stores.
It is based in the United Kingdom but operates in 13 different countries in Europe, Asia, America, and Oceania.

Restaurants and convenience stores can benefit from Just Eat's large pool of customers to grow their business and find new clients.
At the same time, they can concentrate on what they do best (preparing food, selling groceries) while Just Eat takes care of the online ordering solution and associated marketing, as well as the delivery logistics.

## Available Platforms

Just Eat Flyt Bridge allows you to connect to HubRise the following platforms:

- Just-Eat.co.uk
- Just-Eat.ie
- SkipTheDishes.com

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you wish to connect a store of the Just Eat Takeaway chain outside Ireland or the United Kingdom, you should use [Just Eat Takeaway Bridge](/apps/just-eat-takeaway/) instead.
