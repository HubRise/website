## Description

Just Eat is an online delivery platform for restaurants and convenience stores.
It is based in the United Kingdom but operates in 13 different countries in Europe, Asia, America, and Oceania.

Just Eat connects to your HubRise account through Just Eat Flyt Bridge, an app developed by HubRise.

## Available Platforms

Just Eat Flyt Bridge allows you to connect to HubRise the following platforms:

- Just-Eat.co.uk
- Just-Eat.ie
- SkipTheDishes.com

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you wish to connect a store of the Just Eat Takeaway chain outside Ireland or the United Kingdom, you should use [Just Eat Takeaway Bridge](/apps/just-eat-takeaway/) instead.

Just Eat Flyt Bridge can be connected to HubRise from the HubRise back office.

## Why Connect?

Connecting your Just Eat online restaurant or convenience store to HubRise allows you to receive Just Eat orders directly in your EPOS or Kitchen Display Screen also connected with HubRise.
You will be able to manage Just Eat orders alongside other orders, using your own tools. Just Eat orders will flow through your existing setup, as all other orders already do.

Via HubRise, synchronise your menu, your customer and order information with online ordering, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat), delivery management, delivery services, eMarketing (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, stock management, loyalty systems, and more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To see which apps you can connect, see our [Apps page](/apps).

## Prerequisites

To establish a connection between Just Eat and HubRise via Just Eat Flyt Bridge, your restaurant must be a Just Eat partner with a store in Ireland or in the United Kingdom.
