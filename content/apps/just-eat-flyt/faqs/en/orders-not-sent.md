  description: This page explains why Just Eat orders are not being sent to HubRise and how to fix the issue.
---

If Just Eat Flyt Bridge is connected and your HubRise catalog is pushed into your Just Eat store, it could happen that orders are not being sent to HubRise.

On this page, we discuss the most common reasons for this issue and how to fix it.

### OrderPad not Switched on

The Just Eat OrderPad needs to remain switched on to receive orders in HubRise. For more information, see [Can I Turn Off the Orderpad?](/apps/just-eat-flyt/faqs/auto-accept/).

### Orders not Accepted

On Just Eat Flyt markets, you can accept orders manually or activate auto-accept for orders to be automatically sent to HubRise. For more information, see [Do I Want Auto-Accept Activated?](/apps/just-eat-flyt/faqs/auto-accept/).

For some markets under the Takeaway.com tech stack, orders also need to be sent to the kitchen before they are sent to HubRise. This applies to the following markets:

- Just-Eat.fr
- Takeaway.com (Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugual, Bulgaria, Romania)
- Thuisbezorgd.nl
- Lieferando (Germany, Austria)
- Pyszne.pl
- Eat.ch
- Vietnammm.com
