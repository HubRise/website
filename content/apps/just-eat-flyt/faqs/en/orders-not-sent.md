  description: This page explains why Just Eat orders are not being sent to HubRise via the HubRiseJust Eat Flyt Bridge.
---

While your HubRise Just Eat Flyt Bridge is connected to your HubRise account, and your HubRise catalog can be successfully pushed into your Just Eat store, orders are not being sent to HubRise. There might be a reason for that. In this page, we discuss some of the things you can check.

The Just Eat OrderPad needs to remain switched on to receive orders in HubRise. For more information, see [Can I Turn Off the Orderpad?](/apps/just-eat-flyt/faqs/auto-accept/)

On Just Eat Flyt markets, you can accept orders manually or activate auto-accept for orders to be automatically sent to HubRise. For more information, see [Do I Want Auto-Accept Activated?](/apps/just-eat-flyt/faqs/auto-accept/)
For markets on the Takeaway.com tech stack however, orders should not only be manually accepted on the OrderPad but also sent to the kitchen before the order information is passed on to HubRise.

List of Just Eat markets on the Takeaway.com tech stack:
- Just-Eat.fr
- Takeaway.com (Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugual, Bulgaria, Romania)
- Thuisbezorgd.nl
