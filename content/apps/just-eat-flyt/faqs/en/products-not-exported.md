  description: This page explains why some products are not sent to Just Eat when you push the catalog to the platform.
---

Just Eat requires that all the products that you push to the platform via API have a ref code. When you export your HubRise catalog to Just Eat, Just Eat Flyt Bridge skips all the products that do not have a ref code.

If after pushing your catalog to Just Eat you notice that some products are missing, you can solve the issue by adding a ref code to the product and by pushing the catalog again to Just Eat.
