  description: This page explains the Just Eat Auto-Accept function when connecting the HubRise Just Eat Flyt Bridge.

---

By default Auto-Accept will be `Deactivated` when connecting the HubRise Just Eat Flyt Bridge.

Ask for Auto-Accept to be `Activated` if you don't want to use the Just Eat OrderPad. When Auto-Accept is activated, orders are sent through HubRise directly to your connected EPOS. The OrderPad needs to be on to keep the store open.

Just Eat does not encourage Auto-Accept. There is an additional risk of missing orders.



-----

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Auto-Accept possible in Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK only. France, Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland are on the Takeaway tech stack, Auto-Accept is not possible for these markets even if the Flyt API is used.
