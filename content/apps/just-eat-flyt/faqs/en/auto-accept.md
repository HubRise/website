  description: This page explains the Just Eat Auto-Accept function when connecting the HubRise Just Eat Flyt Bridge.
---

If you do not want to use the Just Eat OrderPad, ask for Auto-Accept to be activated. When Auto-Accept is activated, orders are sent through HubRise directly to your connected EPOS, and you do not need to accept each order manually on the tablet.

Just Eat does not encourage Auto-Accept, because of the risk of missing orders.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Even with Auto-Accept activated, the OrderPad needs to remain switched on to keep the store open.

Auto-Accept is only available in the following markets:

- Ireland
- Italy
- Spain
- United Kingdom
- Canada with Skip The Dishes
- Australia with Menulog

Auto-Accept can be activated by the Just Eat Flyt team when setting up the integration. It can also be activated by the Just Eat support team after the connection with HubRise.
For Menulog, contact [techsupport@menulog.com](mailto:techsupport@menulog.com) and ask them to activate it. It cannot be activated during the integration set up.

France, Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland are on the Takeaway tech stack. Auto-Accept is not available for these markets, even with the Just Eat Flyt integration. However Just Eat is working on this feature which should become available in the months to come. For now, Auto-Accept can be activated in France for instance if the restaurant uses Scoober or Stuart delivery services.
