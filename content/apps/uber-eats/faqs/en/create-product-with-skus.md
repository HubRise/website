Uber Eats menus do not natively support products with multiple variations, such as a pizza available in multiple sizes.
However, Uber Eats items with a specific structure are interpreted as products with variations by Uber Eats Bridge.
This page describes the conventional structure you need to use to create products with variations.

In HubRise, a variation of a product is called [sku](/docs/data#view-catalog), and can represent, for example, each specific size of the parent product.
If your EPOS supports products with skus, and you want to receive such products in your Uber Eats orders, you have the following two options:

- If you [push your HubRise catalog](/apps/uber-eats/pulling-menu) into Uber Eats with Uber Eats Bridge, products with skus are automatically created with the correct format on Uber Eats.
- If you manually create your menu with [Menu Maker](https://merchants.ubereats.com/us/en/technology/simplify-operations/menu-management/), the catalog management tool in Uber Eats back office, create your products following the steps on this page. 


## Product Structure

In Menu Maker, there are two main building blocks: items and modifier groups.

To create a product with multiple skus, you need to create the following structure using items and modifier groups:
- Parent product (Item)
  - Choice of skus (Modifier group)
    - Sku 1 (Item)
    - Sku 2 (Item)
    - Sku 3 (Item)

For example, if you want to create a pizza size variations, use the following structure:
- Pizza Margherita (Item)
  - Choose your Margherita size (Modifier group)
    - Pizza Margherita 8" (Item)
    - Pizza Margherita 10" (Item)
    - Pizza Margherita 12" (Item)

To ensure that Uber Eats Bridge sends the correct information to HubRise when customers order a product with a sku, follow this convention:

- The ref code of the parent product, in this case `Pizza Margherita`, must be `MULTISKU`.
- Invidivual skus must have the same ref code they have in your EPOS.
