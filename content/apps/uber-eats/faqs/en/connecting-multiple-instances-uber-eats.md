It is possible to connect multiple Uber Eats stores to the same HubRise location. This can be helpful if you intend to receive all Uber Eats orders in the same EPOS, regardless of the store they originate from.

Connect multiple instances of Uber Eats Bridge to the same HubRise location by following the instructions in the [HubRise documentation](/docs/faqs/connect-multiple-instances-same-app). For each new connection, you should specify the Store UUID for the Uber Eats store you want to connect.
