  title: Connect Uber Eats to HubRise - Sending orders to EPOS directly
  description: Description of Uber Eats manual and direct modes for receiving orders, and instructions on how to receive orders directly to the EPOS without confirming them on the Uber Eats tablets first.

Uber Eats allows restaurants to receive orders in two different modes: **manual accept** and **offered state**.

- With **manual accept** mode, new orders need to be accepted on Uber Eats tablet first, and after that they are sent to the EPOS.
- With **offered state** mode, new orders are directly sent to the EPOS, and they need to be accepted or rejected there.

Uber Eats controls which mode is activated on your store from their back office.

HubRise supports both modes seemlessly. Let us know which mode suits your business needs best during the initial configuration. For more information, see [Connect to HubRise](/apps/uber-eats/connect-hubrise).

If you do not specify your preferred mode, your store will be use the offered state mode by default.
However, we recommend that you start in manual accept mode for a few weeks regardless, to make sure that your setup works as expected, and later switch to offered state mode. At any moment, you can switch to a different mode by contacting your Uber Eats Account Manager.
