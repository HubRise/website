Before you can receive Uber Eats orders in HubRise, the API functionalities need to be activated in your Uber Eats account. Don't worry, HubRise will take care of the process for you.

Contact us at [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com) and include the following information in your email:

- The URL link(s) of your Uber Eats store(s) you wish to connect. For instance, [https://www.ubereats.com/gb/london/food-delivery/basilico-lavender-hill/tG_8KYb4RkaRPKOmZuERUA](https://www.ubereats.com/gb/london/food-delivery/basilico-lavender-hill/tG_8KYb4RkaRPKOmZuERUA).
- The email address you logged in the Uber Eats back office and use to communicate with Uber Eats.
- Your HubRise account and location IDs. If you don't have a HubRise Account, go to the [HubRise Signup Page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup) and follow the instructions. If your restaurant called Fast Pizza is located in Baker Street, your location ID may be `Fast Pizza Baker Street z6q31-0`.

We will then contact Uber Eats on your behalf to enable the connection and get back to you with the Uber Eats Store UUID you will need to enter during the setup process.
