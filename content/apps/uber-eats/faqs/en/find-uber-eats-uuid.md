The Uber Eats UUID is the unique identifier for your Uber Eats store. It is also referred to as the Uber Eats ID.

To find your Uber Eats UUID, follow these steps in your browser:

1. Log in to your [Uber Eats back office](https://merchants.ubereats.com).
1. Select the correct location from the dropdown menu.
1. Look at the URL of the page. Your Uber Eats UUID will be the number after `/home/`. For example, if the URL is `https://merchants.ubereats.com/manager/home/cd48e888-d8e8-5dd4-9887-ea816b4f1634`, the Uber Eats UUID is `cd48e888-d8e8-5dd4-9887-ea816b4f1634`.
