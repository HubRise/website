Pushing your HubRise catalog into Uber Eats will erase the menu on your Uber Eats store. A catalog push will also update your Uber Eats **Opening hours** and **Customer notes** settings as defined in the Uber Eats Bridge **Configuration** page. As this action cannot be reverted, you might want to take note of the opening hours, verify if customer notes are in use and make a copy of your Uber Eats menu to keep it as backup.

To make a copy of the Uber Eats menu before a menu push, follow these steps.

## 1. Uber Eats Menu Pull

As a first step, pull your Uber Eats menu into a HubRise Catalog. For more information, see [Pull the Catalog](/apps/uber-eats/pull-catalog).

## 2. Duplicate Catalog 

After the Uber Eats menu pull, use Catalog Manager to duplicate the catalog and keep it as back up.

To duplicate the catalog, follow these steps:

1. Select **CONNECTIONS** on your HubRise back office.
1. Click **Open** next to the Catalog Manager app. Catalog Manager will open in a new browser tab.
1. Identify the catalog attached to Uber Eats Bridge, open the **Actions** dropdown and select **Duplicate**.
1. Use a clear naming convention, for example `Uber Eats_backup`.

## 3. Edit or Pull Catalog

Once duplicated, you can safely push a new menu into your HubRise catalog or edit it. 

To push a menu into the HubRise catalog attached to your Uber Eats Bridge, see the related app documentation in our [Apps page](/apps). To edit the catalog instead, you can use Catalog Manager.

To edit the catalog, follow these steps:

1. Select **CONNECTIONS** on your HubRise back office.
1. Click **Open** next to the Catalog Manager app. Catalog Manager will open in a new browser tab.
1. Identify the catalog attached to the Uber Eats Bridge, click **Open**.
1. Edit the catalog.
1. Click **Save** changes.


## 4. Push Catalog Into Uber Eats

Once your catalog is ready, you can push it manually into your Uber Eats store. For more information, see [Manual Catalog Push](/apps/uber-eats/push-catalog).
