Uber Eats menus do not natively support deals, such as a pizza + drink combination at a discounted price.
However, Uber Eats items with a specific structure are interpreted as deals by Uber Eats Bridge.
This page describes the conventional structure you need to use to create deals.

If your EPOS supports deals, and you want to receive them in your Uber Eats orders, you have the following two options:

- If you [push your HubRise catalog](/apps/uber-eats/pulling-menu) into Uber Eats with Uber Eats Bridge, deals are automatically created with the correct format on Uber Eats.
- If you manually create your menu with [Menu Maker](https://merchants.ubereats.com/us/en/technology/simplify-operations/menu-management/), the catalog management tool in Uber Eats back office, create your deals following the steps on this page.

## Deal Structure

In Menu Maker, there are two main building blocks: items and modifier groups.

To create a deal, you need to create the following structure using items and modifier groups:

- Deal (Item)
  - Deal line 1 (Modifier group)
    - Product 1 (Item)
    - Product 2 (Item)
    - Product 3 (Item)
  - Deal line 2 (Modifier group)
    - Product 1 (Item)
    - Product 2 (Item)
    - Product 3 (Item)

For example, if you have a deal with pizzas and drinks, use the following structure:

- Pizza + Drink Deal (Item)
  - Choose your pizza (Modifier group)
    - Pizza Margherita (Item)
    - Pizza Napoli (Item)
    - Pizza Diavola (Item)
  - Choose your drink (Modifier group)
    - Coca-Cola (Item)
    - Pepsi (Item)
    - Beer (Item)

To ensure that Uber Eats Bridge sends the correct information to HubRise when customers order a deal, follow this convention:

- The ref code of the item that represents the deal, in this case `Pizza + Drink Deal`, must start with `DEAL-`, followed by the ref code of the deal in your EPOS.
- Items in the deal lines must have the same ref code they have in your EPOS.
