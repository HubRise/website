When placing an order with a restaurant on the Uber Eats platform, customers may request disposable, single-use items like utensils, straws and napkins. To see this request in the EPOS, or other apps connected to your HubRise account, you need to configure the Uber Eats Bridge on HubRise correctly. Failing this, you will not see the item in the order.

Not all Uber Eats restaurants offer their customers the option to request disposable items. It can be disabled on Uber Eats. Nonetheless, HubRise recommends configuring it in case this option is enabled at a later date.

To configure the Uber Eats Bridge disposable items on HubRise, follow these steps: 
1. Create a `Disposable items` product in your EPOS, and take note of the ref code.
1. Open your HubRise back office. If you have access to multiple Accounts, select the **Account** containing the Uber Eats Bridge to configure.
1. Go to **CONNECTIONS**.
1. Identify the **Uber Eats Bridge**, and click **Open**.
1. Select **Configuration** on the top menu tab.
1. Find **Special items** > **Disposable items ref code** field in the configuration page and add your EPOS disposable items product ref code. For example `1245`.
1. Click **Save**.
