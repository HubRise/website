When placing an order on the Uber Eats platform, customers may request disposable, single-use items like utensils, straws and napkins. To receive this request in your EPOS, or other apps connected to your HubRise account, you need to configure Uber Eats Bridge accordingly.

Not all Uber Eats restaurants offer their customers the option to request disposable items. It can be disabled on Uber Eats. Nonetheless, HubRise recommends configuring it in case this option is enabled at a later date.

To configure the Uber Eats Bridge disposable items on HubRise, follow these steps:

1. Create a `Disposable items` product in your EPOS, and take note of the ref code.
1. Open your HubRise back office. If you have access to multiple Accounts, select the **Account** containing the restaurant to configure.
1. Go to **CONNECTIONS**.
1. Identify the **Uber Eats Bridge**, and click **Open**.
1. Select **Configuration** on the top menu tab.
1. Find **Special items** > **Disposable items ref code** field in the configuration page and add your EPOS disposable items product ref code. For example `1245`.
1. Click **Save**.
