With Uber Eats Bridge, you can push your HubRise catalog into your Uber Eats store with a single click.

You can also configure the bridge to push your catalog to Uber Eats every time it is updated on HubRise. For more information, see [Catalog](/apps/uber-eats/configuration#catalog).

This page explains how to push your catalog, and what information is sent to Uber Eats.

## Populate a HubRise Catalog

To update your menu in Uber Eats, you should have a HubRise catalog first. Many apps connected with HubRise, including EPOS solutions, online ordering solutions and food ordering and delivery platforms offer the ability to push their menu into HubRise. Refer to your app documentation on the HubRise [Apps page](/apps) to verify.

Alternatively, you can populate a HubRise catalog by pulling the menu from an existing Deliveroo or Uber Eats store. For more information, refer to these links:

- [Pull a Catalog from Deliveroo](/apps/deliveroo/pull-catalog)
- [Pull a Catalog from Uber Eats](/apps/uber-eats/pull-catalog)

## Manual Catalog Push

Once your catalog is populated on HubRise, you can push it manually to your Uber Eats store by following these steps:

1. Log in to your [HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com).
1. Select the HubRise account and location connected with your Uber Eats store.
1. Open the **CONNECTIONS** page, then select **Uber Eats Bridge** from the list of connected apps.
1. In Uber Eats Bridge, select the **Actions** tab, check the name and the ID of the HubRise catalog, then click **Push catalog**.
1. Check your Uber Eats online menu.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** A catalog push also updates your Uber Eats **Opening hours** and **Customer notes** settings, as defined in the **Configuration** page. Before pushing the catalog, make sure that these settings are correct.

1. Select the HubRise account and location connected with your Uber Eats store.
1. Open the **CONNECTIONS** page, then select **Uber Eats Bridge** from the list of connected apps.
1. In Uber Eats Bridge, select the **Configuration** tab.
1. In the **Catalog** section, tick **Enable automatic catalog push**.
1. Click **Save**.

## Information Sent to Uber Eats {#information-sent-to-uber-eats}

The following sections provide more details on how your HubRise catalog is mapped to Uber Eats.

### Categories

Uber Eats Bridge maps HubRise categories to Uber Eats categories. The category name, ref code, and description are sent to Uber Eats. By default, categories are flattened.

For retail stores, two-level mode can be enabled. In this mode, top-level categories are sent as menus, with their subcategories listed within each menu. In Uber Eats, menus appear as main categories, similar to supermarket aisles (e.g., Drinks → Sodas, Beers).

Two-level mode is only available for retail stores. It must be enabled by Uber Eats support and activated in the [Configuration Page](/apps/uber-eats/configuration#category-structure).

### Products and Skus

Uber Eats Bridge maps single sku products one-to-one to products on Uber Eats, sending the following information:

- Sku name
- Sku ref code
- Description
- Images
- Price
- Options
- Tags including allergens
- Tax rates
- Time restrictions

For products with multiple skus, Uber Eats Bridge creates a product, a modifier list, and one modifier for each sku.
Options are attached to each sku as an extra layer of modifiers.

### Options List and Options

Uber Eats Bridge maps option lists and options one-to-one to Uber Eats.

### Deals

Uber Eats Bridge maps HubRise deals to products with modifiers on Uber Eats.

### Images

Images must be between 320×320 and 6000×6000 pixels, with an aspect ratio between 1:1 and 1.5:1.

### Deals

For each deal in the catalog, Uber Eats Bridge creates a Uber Eats product with the following details:

By default, when customers order a deal, they must choose one product for every deal line.
