With Uber Eats Bridge, you can pull your Uber Eats menu into a HubRise catalog.

This can be useful if you want to:

- Create a backup of your Uber Eats menu.
- Edit your Uber Eats menu in HubRise Catalog Manager, an app included in your HubRise subscription, and push it back to Uber Eats or other platforms including Deliveroo and Just Eat.

To pull your Uber Eats menu into a HubRise catalog, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com).
1. If you have access to multiple Accounts, select the **Account** containing the specific Location.
1. Select the Location from the **Location** dropdown.
1. Open the **CONNECTIONS** page.
1. Find **Uber Eats Bridge** from the list of connected apps, and click **Open**. This will open Uber Eats Bridge in a new tab.
1. Click the **Actions** tab
1. In the **Pull the catalog from Uber Eats** section, verify that the correct HubRise catalog is connected, click **Pull catalog**, and confirm the action.
