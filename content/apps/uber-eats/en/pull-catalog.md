With Uber Eats Bridge, you can pull your Uber Eats menu into a HubRise catalog.

This allows you to manage your menu from a single location using Catalog Manager, an app included in your HubRise subscription, and to push it to other apps such as Deliveroo and Just Eat.

To pull your Uber Eats menu into HubRise, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com)
1. If you have access to multiple Accounts, select the **Account** containing the specific Location.
1. Select the Location from the **Location** dropdown.
1. Open the **CONNECTIONS** page.
1. Find **Uber Eats Bridge** from the list of connected apps, and click **Open**. This will open Uber Eats Bridge in a new tab.
1. Click the **Actions** tab
1. In the **Pull the catalog from Uber Eats** verify the catalog attached to your Uber Eats Bridge.
1. Click **Pull catalog**, and confirm the action.
