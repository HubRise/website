The Configuration page allows you to customise the behaviour of the Uber Eats Bridge based on your preferences.
These are divided into different categories for an easier navigation.

## Menu

This section allows you to customise the behaviour of the menu.

When you select the checkbox, your HubRise catalog will be synced with the Uber Eats menu, and every time you make a change to your HubRise catalog, this will be reflected on Uber Eats.

## Order Statuses

Uber Eats has only three possible statuses for the orders: accepted, denied, and cancelled.

You can therefore decide which HubRise status triggers a certain status on Uber Eats. For example, when an order is marked as "received" on HubRise, this will automatically mark the order as "accepted" on Uber Eats.

On the other hand, you can also customise which status to use on HubRise for new orders received from Uber Eats. This choice typically depends on the status your POS expects to receive.

## Special Ref Codes and Other Options

This section allows you to customise several miscellaneous options: // JW

- The service type ref code associated to Uber Eats orders.
- The payment type and ref code associated with Uber Eats orders.
- The ref code used when a customer includes disposable items in an order. //JW

## Saving the Configuration

Once you are happy with the configuration of the Uber Eats Bridge, click **Save** at the top of the page to continue to the main page. // JW

## Resetting the Configuration

You can always restore the Configuration page to its default values and change the Uber Eats store ID associated with your HubRise location by clicking on **Reset the configuration** at the bottom of the page. // JW
