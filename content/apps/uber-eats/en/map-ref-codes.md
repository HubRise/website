Most EPOS solutions require a ref code for each product to correctly parse orders. Therefore, when you create your menu on Uber Eats, you need to make sure that each product is assigned to the correct ref code.

## Assigning Ref Codes To Products

To assign ref codes to your Uber Eats products, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [Uber Eats back office](https://restaurant.uber.com/).
1. If you have a single Uber Eats store, select **Menu** from the menu on the left. If you have multiple Uber Eats stores, select the correct one from the dropdown menu, then select **Menu**.
1. Select **Items** from the top menu.

1. Click the **Extra Details** section to expand.

1. Enter the ref code in the **External Data** field.
1. Click **Save** to go back to the items list.

You will need to repeat this manual procedure for all your available items.

Note that items in the **Modifier Groups** tab also have the **External Data** field, but you generally do not need to enter any value as this is not sent to the EPOS.
