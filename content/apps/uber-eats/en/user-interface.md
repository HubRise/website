---

From the main page of the Uber Eats Bridge, you can access the configuration settings of the app and read the logs of all the transactions between HubRise and Uber Eats.

## Navigation

The central portion of the page displays a list of all the recent API exchanges between HubRise, Uber Eats Bridge and Uber Eats.

At the top right corner of the main page, you can click on the arrow <InlineImage width="20" height="20">![Arrow icon](../images/arrow-icon.jpg)</InlineImage> to expand the menu. From there, you can select the language of the page and access the configuration page.

## API logs

Clicking on each operation on the main page will take you to the detailed logs of that specific operation.

Logs are a powerful debugging tool in case of issues. To understand in detail how to read logs, see the [HubRise documentation](/docs/hubrise-logs/).
