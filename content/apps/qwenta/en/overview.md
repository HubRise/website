## Description

Qwenta is a QR code-based table payment solution designed for Swiss restaurants.

With Qwenta guests can rapidly settle their bills, reducing waiting times and streamlining the payment experience into a smooth, straightforward process.
This way, guests enjoy their meal right up to the end, while restaurateurs optimise service and improve efficiency.

**How did it work?**
When an order is registered in your EPOS, it is automatically sent to Qwenta. By scanning a QR code on their table, customers can pay their bill autonomously. They have the option to split the bill, add a tip, leave feedback, and complete payment with just a few clicks.

Your EPOS is instantly updated with the payment status, and the table is automatically closed.

## Integration Features

Connecting Qwenta to HubRise allows your payment solution to:

- Pull orders from HubRise.

Qwenta can be connected to HubRise from the Qwenta back office.
