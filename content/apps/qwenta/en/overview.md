## Description

Qwenta is a QR code-based table payment solution designed for Swiss restaurants.

With Qwenta guests can rapidly settle their bills, reducing waiting times and streamlining the payment experience into a smooth, straightforward process.
Guests enjoy their meal right up to the end, without having to wait before leaving, while restaurateurs optimise service and improve efficiency.

### How does it work?

When an order is registered in your EPOS, it is automatically sent to Qwenta. By scanning a QR code on their table, customers can pay their bill autonomously. They have the option to split the bill, add a tip, leave feedback, and complete payment with just a few clicks.

Your EPOS is instantly updated with the payment status, and the table is automatically closed in the EPOS.

## Integration Features

Connecting Qwenta to HubRise allows your payment solution to:

- Pull orders from HubRise.
- Pull order modifications from HubRise: payments and item changes.
- Push order modifications into HubRise: payments.

Qwenta can be connected to HubRise from the Qwenta back office.

## Why Connect?

By connecting Qwenta to HubRise, you allow your payment solution to receive orders from your EPOS and automatically close them once payment is made.

With HubRise, you can synchronise your menu, customer information, and orders between your EPOS, your online ordering solution, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat), delivery management solutions or delivery services, eMarketing solutions (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, inventory, and customer loyalty systems, and much more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To discover the apps you can connect, visit our [Apps page](/apps).
