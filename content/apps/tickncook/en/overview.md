## Description

TicknCook is a Kitchen Display System (KDS). It digitalises restaurant receipts to facilitate the preparation of takeaway, delivery and dine-in orders.
It displays orders and tracks the status of individual items on production screens available in the kitchen and at the counter. A specific delivery screen helps group orders and organise deliveries.

TicknCook optimises production and helps manage priorities and delays. The restaurant manager can analyse his results using the statistics screen.
It works on any touch screen, TicknCook is above all ultra connected, easy to use, and offers a simple online installation.

Available in English and French, TicknCook offers a free trial period to let you test it without technical constraints or commercial agreement.
