## Technical Details

### Items and Options

Items in HubRise orders are recognised by Quantum based on their ref codes. Items with invalid ref codes are associated with a default product. The price in HubRise takes precedence over the price in Quantum.

Options are handled in a similar way as items.

### Order Statuses

When an order is received from HubRise, Quantum immediately changes its status to **Received**. Furthermore, if auto-accept mode is enabled, the order status is then automatically updated to **In preparation**, unless one of the items is out of stock.

Status changes made in Quantum are reflected in HubRise.

### Discounts

Discounts in HubRise orders are applied in Quantum using the same name and amount. The ref code is discarded.

### Charges

Charges in HubRise orders are applied in Quantum using the same name and amount. The ref code is discarded.

### Payments

Payments in HubRise orders are processed in Quantum using only the amount, not the ref codes. The payment method is associated based on the `created_by` field in HubRise.

If an order is fully paid, Quantum marks it as paid; otherwise, the operator must handle it manually.

### Customer Information

Quantum only supports guest orders. The customer information from HubRise orders is used, including the customer's name, email, and phone number, which are displayed in the order details.

### Customer Notes

Customer notes in HubRise orders are used by Quantum at both the order level and the item level. These notes are printed on receipts and displayed in the order details.
