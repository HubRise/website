## Connect Quantum

Only the Cunninghams EPOS Group support team can connect your Quantum EPOS to HubRise.

1. Contact the Cunninghams support team who will establish the connection to HubRise. For more information, see [Contact Cunninghams Support](#contact).

## Grant Access to Cunninghams Support {#give-access}

To connect Quantum, you need to grant Cunninghams support access to your HubRise account. This will also allow Cunninghams support to troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.

To grant access to Cunninghams, proceed as follows:

Adding a user is the recommended way to grant access to a third party to your HubRise account or location. Sharing passwords is not recommended for security reasons. For more information on permissions, see the [Permissions](/docs/permissions) help page.
