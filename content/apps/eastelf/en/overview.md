## Description

Eatself is a solution designed for restaurant owners looking to digitalise their business, without intermediaries or commissions. With Eatself, you can deploy a complete solution — with no technical skills required — Eatself to manage customer relationships and sales both on-site and remotely, via various digital channels.

The solution includes:

- **Online ordering**: Click & Collect, home delivery, and pay at the table via QR code.
- **Ordering kiosk**: Touchscreen self-ordering kiosks available in various formats (countertop, freestanding, wall-mounted) to manage in-house customer flow.
- **Digital menu**: Online menu, facilitating real time updates, with allergen and dietary information management.
- **Online booking**: Integrated booking system to reduce the number of phone calls related to reservations.
- **Loyalty**: Points-based loyalty programme to reward returning customers.
- **Delivery**: Option to use your own drivers or connect with third-party providers such as Stuart or Uber Direct.
- **Fair pricing**, with a free plan and paid options depending on the features activated.

Key benefits of Eatself:

- **0% commission**: Unlike traditional delivery platforms, Eatself takes no commission on sales. Restaurant owners keep all their profit margins.
- **You stay connected with your customers**: Orders are placed via your own interface, not a marketplace. You have access to your customers’ contact details and you can run your own loyalty and marketing campaigns.
- **Quick setup**: The solution comes pre-configured and training is included. It is designed to be up and running from day one, with no specific technical knowledge required.
- **Measurable impact on sales**: On average, restaurant owners using Eatself see a 26% increase in revenue. This is thanks to a smooth interface, reduced queues via kiosks, better presentation of menus, and easier upselling.
- **Cost-effective ordering kiosk**: The touchscreen kiosk is provided with no hidden fees or commission. The Eatself kiosk offers a budget-friendly alternative to typically more expensive market options.
- **Dedicated customer support**: Personalised support is available to help you get the most out of the solution’s features.
- **Integration with delivery platforms**: If you use delivery platforms, Eatself can connect them directly to your EPOS. Your orders are automatically centralised — no manual entry required — and fully integrated into your existing workflow.
