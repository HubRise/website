## Description

With Châtaigne, restaurants can sell meals for delivery or takeaway through a WhatsApp conversation.
Each restaurant is assigned a WhatsApp number, through which customers can start a conversation to browse the menu, place an order via voice or text message, ask questions, make a payment, and receive updates without the need to download an application or create an account.

Orders placed via WhatsApp are instantly sent either to Châtaigne's dashboard or directly to the restaurant’s EPOS. Châtaigne’s intuitive user interface makes it easy to organise and manage orders, helping restaurant staff save time and reduce errors by consolidating all interactions in one place.

Launched in 2024, Châtaigne is already adopted by independent restaurants and chai­nes in France and Switzerland. Specifically designed to meet the needs of the European market, the solution integrates easily with existing tools and helps restaurants improve profitability by reducing dependence on traditional delivery platforms.
