## Description

Tick'Eat is a multi-platform EPOS solution designed by and for restaurateurs, compatible with Android, iOS, tablets, phones, and PCs.

Tick’Eat includes the features and services necessary for managing your establishment without the need to subscribe to additional options or third-party solutions.

Tick’Eat can handle on-site and online orders via Uber Eats, Deliveroo, Just Eat, or a white-label online ordering solution. You can also connect self ordering kiosks or a mobile app operating with QR codes or NFC. Tick'Eat's user interface allows for intuitive menu updates and their synchronisation with online ordering platforms.

A dispatching solution helps organise order deliveries with the restaurant’s fleet of delivery drivers: the EPOS assigns a driver, and the customer is notified when their order is dispatched.

## Integration Features

- Pull orders from HubRise, including order status.
- Pull customer information from HubRise.
- Push a catalog into HubRise, with variants support.
