## Description

Tick'Eat is a multi-platform EPOS solution designed by and for restaurateurs. Compatible with Android, iOS, tablets, smartphones and PC, it offers remarkable flexibility. Tick’Eat includes all the features and services needed for an optimised restaurant management, without the need to subscribe to additional options or third-party solutions.

Tick’Eat helps manage on-site orders, with ordering at the counter, at the table by the waiter, or autonomously via a self-ordering kiosk or the client's own smartphone using QR codes or NFC.

Tick'Eat also facilitates the management of online orders via food ordering and delivery platforms such as Uber Eats, Deliveroo and Just Eat, as well as those coming from your own online ordering solution. The intuitive Tick'Eat user interface helps to ease your menus updates.

A dispatching solution helps you organise order deliveries with your own delivery staff. From the EPOS, a delivery driver is assigned and the client is notified when the order is on its way.

- Pull orders from HubRise, including order status.
