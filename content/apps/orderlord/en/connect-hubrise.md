Then, contact OrderLord support at [support@orderlord.com](mailto:support@orderlord.com) and provide them with your HubRise account name and ID and the specific locations where you want to activate the integration.
OrderLord support will be able to access your account and enable the integration for you.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: If you plan to support collection and in-store orders, you should ask OrderLord to activate this functionality in your initial request.

Once the connection is enabled, you will see OrderLord in the list of apps connected to your location in your HubRise back office.
