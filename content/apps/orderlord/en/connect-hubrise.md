## Enable the HubRise integration

Before you connect to HubRise, contact OrderLord support on [support@orderlord.com](mailto:support@orderlord.com) and ask them to enable the integration with HubRise. Data will not flow from HubRise to OrderLord until they activate the API.

TODO: How do users actually connect?

Once the connection is enabled, you will see OrderLord in the list of apps connected to your location in your HubRise back office.
