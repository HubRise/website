OrderLord relies on product ref codes to correctly identify the products. You need to use the same codes in your food delivery or online ordering platform to be able to receive orders correctly.

## Finding ref codes

To find the ref codes for specific items, follow these steps.

- From your OrderLord back office, select **Settings**, then **POS menu**.
- Identify the row with the menu you want to inspect, then click the <InlineImage width="21" height="21">![Set items icon](../images/set-items-icon.png)</InlineImage> **Set items** icon.
- Click on a category from the list to reveal the list of items in that category.
- Click on an item to show its details. The item ref code appears in the **Public ID** field.

You can now copy this code in the connected app. For detailed instructions, follow the steps in the connected app's documentation in the HubRise website.
