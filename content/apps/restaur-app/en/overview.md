It offers restaurants the opportunity to launch their own website and mobile app with a monthly subscription but no time commitment, no commission on sales (excluding bank fees).

Restaur'App includes a multitude of features, such as online sales, product management, the choice between several pickup methods (click and collect, delivery), and table reservations.
It includes features such as secure payment, order management, tracking for operational teams and delivery staff, as well as customers loyalty options such as a loyalty programme, deals, and notifications on special offers.

## Integration Features

By connecting Restaur'App to HubRise, your ordering solutions can communicate with your other everyday applications.
