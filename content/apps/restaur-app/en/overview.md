## Description

Restaur'App, developed by the Anthemis agency, is an all-in-one solution designed for fast food outlets for delivery and takeaway. It offers these businesses the opportunity to launch their website and mobile application for online ordering. Restaur'App is available through a monthly subscription, with no commitment and no commission on sales (excluding bank fees).

Restaur'App provides a multitude of features and customization options for online sales, product management, delivery management, and table reservations. It includes secure payment, order management, delivery tracking, a loyalty program, promotions, and mobile customer notifications.

## Integration Features

Connecting Restaur'App to HubRise allows your Restaur'App ordering solutions to:

- Push orders into HubRise, including order status.
- Pull order modifications from HubRise related to payments.
- Pull a catalog from HubRise, with variants support.

Restaur'App can be connected to HubRise from the Restaur'App back office.

## Why Connect?

By connecting Restaur'App to HubRise, your ordering solutions can communicate with your other everyday applications. Send orders from your online ordering solution or from your app to your EPOS, to an intelligent, connected and autonomous printer, to a Kitchen Display Screen or your inventory management solution. Pull the menu from your EPOS in Restaur'App via HubRise.

With HubRise, you can synchronise your menu, customer information, and orders between your EPOS, your online ordering solution, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat), delivery management solutions or delivery services, eMarketing solutions (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, inventory, and customer loyalty systems, and much more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To see which apps you can connect, see our [Apps page](/apps).
