## Description

Designed and developed in Bordeaux by TB Syst√®mes, BWares is a complete self-service ordering kiosk solution designed for high-traffic retail locations: fast food restaurants, bakeries, butcher shops, leisure venues, etc.

It integrates with EPOS solutions via HubRise to automatically send orders to production stations.

BWares allows you to:

- Streamline the ordering process by reducing queues.
- Suggest complementary items to increase the average basket size.
- Fully customise the interface according to the establishment's visual identity.
- Manage content (products, visuals, etc.) via an online user interface.
- Display promotional content between orders.

Custom developments are offered when specific business needs require them.

## Integration Features

Connecting BWares to HubRise allows your self-ordering kiosk to:

- Push orders into HubRise, including order status.
- Push customer information into HubRise.
- Pull a catalog from HubRise, with variants support.
- Synchronise inventory with HubRise.
- Synchronise opening hours with HubRise.

BWares can be connected to HubRise from the BWares back office.

You can refer to the [HubRise documentation](https://bwares.notion.site/HubRise-23e20882788c8014a9adf1dad49ce6e7) on the BWares website for more information on how the integration works.

## Why Connect?

By connecting BWares Kiosks to HubRise, your self-ordering kiosk can communicate with your other everyday applications. Push the orders saved on your self-ordering kiosk into your EPOS, to an autonomous printer, a Kitchen Display System, or your inventory management system. Import your menu into BWares.

With HubRise, you can synchronise your menu, customer information, and orders between your EPOS, your online ordering solution, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat), delivery management solutions or delivery services, eMarketing solutions (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, inventory, and customer loyalty systems, and much more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To discover the apps you can connect, visit our [Apps page](/apps).
