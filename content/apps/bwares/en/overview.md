## Why Connect?

By connecting BWares Kiosks to HubRise, your self-ordering kiosk can communicate with your other everyday applications. Push the orders saved on your self-ordering kiosk into your EPOS, to an intelligent, connected and autonomous printer, a Kitchen Display System, or your inventory management system. Import your menu into BWares.

With HubRise, you can synchronise your menu, customer information, and orders between your EPOS, your online ordering solution, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat), delivery management solutions or delivery services, eMarketing solutions (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, inventory, and customer loyalty systems, and much more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To discover the apps you can connect, visit our [Apps page](/apps).
