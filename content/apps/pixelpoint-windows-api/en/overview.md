## Description

PAR PixelPoint is an EPOS solution available worldwide.

PixelPoint Windows API is an app developed by Slowey Systems that allows the communication between HubRise and the PAR PixelPoint EPOS.

It takes any incoming order in HubRise, converts it into the PixelPoint format and sends it to the EPOS.

## Integration Features

Connecting PAR PixelPoint to HubRise allows your EPOS to:

- Pull orders from HubRise.
- Pull customer information from HubRise.

PixelPoint Windows API can be connected to HubRise via the Slowey Systems support line.

## Why Connect ?

Connecting PixelPoint Windows API to HubRise allows your EPOS to communicate with other applications you use every day. Receive orders from your online ordering solution, or food delivery platforms in your EPOS.

With HubRise, you can synchronise your menu, customer information, and orders between your EPOS, your online ordering solution, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat), delivery management solutions or delivery services, eMarketing solutions (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, inventory, and customer loyalty systems, and much more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To discover the apps you can connect, visit our [Apps page](/apps).

## Prerequisites

To establish a successful connection with your PAR PixelPoint EPOS, PixelPoint Windows API requires a server running in your store with the following apps:

- Windows OS
- Pixel SQLbase
- Pixel License Manager

PixelPoint Windows API also requires another server, managed by Slowey Systems, which is necessary to establish the connection between HubRise and the store server.
