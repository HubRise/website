  description: Instructions on connecting PixelPoint Windows API with HubRise for your EPOS to work with other apps as a cohesive whole. Synchronise your data.
---

The setup process for connecting PixelPoint Windows API to HubRise is typically performed by Slowey Systems, and is completely transparent to the user.

If you plan to integrate your PAR PixelPoint EPOS with Deliveroo, you need to check that your Deliveroo products are correctly mapped in your EPOS. To learn more about the steps required, see [Integrating with Deliveroo](/apps/pixelpoint-windows-api/map-ref-codes/#integrating-with-deliveroo).

## Setup

To set up the PixelPoint Windows API integration, follow these steps.

- Create a `C:\HubRise` folder at the root level of the store server.
- Copy all the relevant files needed for the connection inside this folder, including a configuration file called `HubRise.ini`.
- Remove any token that might be present in the configuration file.
- Run the `HubRise.exe` program. This will populate the token in the configuration file and create the store in the Slowey database. Then, it will connect the server with HubRise and start fetching orders.

### Sample Configuration File

The following code shows a sample configuration file. The parameters are grouped under different sections, with the relative name in square brackets. A complete description of each section is given below.

| `Token`                                       | The unique API token assigned to the store by HubRise. It is auto populated when the store server establishes its first connection with the Slowey server.                                                                                                                                             |
| `Manual Accept`                               | This parameter has two possible values. When it is set to false, any incoming order is automatically accepted by the POS. When it is set to true, each order has to be manually accepted by the store manager. In this case, a separate application must be used to review and accept incoming orders. |
| `Clear Hours`                                 | If an order is older than the Clear Hours offset, it is removed from HubRise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `Temp`                                        | The local folder where JSON requests coming from HubRise are saved and converted to XML.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
