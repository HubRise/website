## Description

foodpanda is an online ordering and food delivery platform part of the Delivery Hero network.
It is present in several countries in Asia, and in Bulgaria and Romania in Europe.

Restaurants can benefit from foodpanda's large pool of customers to grow their business and find new clients.
At the same time, they can concentrate on what they do best (preparing food) while letting foodpanda take care of the logistics of food delivery.

## Integration Features

foodpanda connects to your HubRise account through foodpanda Bridge, an app developed by HubRise.

Connecting foodpanda Bridge allows foodpanda to:

- Push orders to HubRise. 
- Push delivery information to HubRise, for orders delivered by your team.
