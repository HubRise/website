## Description

Kurve Kiosks designs and develops dynamic self ordering kiosks technology for hospitality operators interested in adopting self-service solutions. Their technology facilitates this transition by providing a customisable, feature-rich, and reliable platform.

Kurve Kiosks observes and try to fully understand customer behaviors to develop tailored ordering solutions that enhance brand value. Their self-service kiosk helps accelerate service, enhance customer experiences, and increase loyalty—especially among younger generations who favor kiosk ordering over traditional face-to-face interactions. Additionally, it offers potential revenue boosts through extra offerings and can reduce operational costs by enabling customers to become more autonomous.

## Integration Features

Connecting Kurve Kiosks to HubRise allows your self-service kiosk to:

- Push orders into HubRise, including order status.
- Pull a catalog from HubRise, with variants support.

Kurve Kiosks can be connected to HubRise via the Kurve Kiosks back office but a support engineer must activate the connection. 

## Why Connect?

By connecting  Kurve Kiosks to HubRise, your self ordering kiosk can communicate with your other everyday applications. Send orders to your EPOS, to an autonomous printer, a Kitchen Display Screen, or to your inventory management solution. Pull your menu from a third-party solution to send it to your self ordering kiosk.

With HubRise, you can synchronise your menu, customer information, and orders between your EPOS, your online ordering solution, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat), delivery management solutions or delivery services, eMarketing solutions (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, inventory, and customer loyalty systems, and much more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To discover the apps you can connect, visit our [Apps page](/apps).
