To link several branches of your LivePepper site to the appropriate HubRise account and locations, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your LivePepper back office.
1. Select the branch to connect.
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Add-ons**.
1. In the **HubRise** section, enable **Share data with other applications**.
1. Click **Connect to HubRise**.
1. If you are an existing HubRise user with set up Accounts and Locations, when prompted, log into HubRise, then:

- Select the HubRise **Account** and **Location** you want to link your LivePepper branch to, then click **Allow**. If you have multiple customer lists or catalogs on HubRise, you will be promoted to click **Next** then select from the **Customer List** or the **Catalog** to connect your branch to.

- If the corresponding HubRise **Account** and **Location** is not available, select **Create a new location** to connect your LivePepper branch to a new HubRise Location. If you select this method, fill in the required fields to create the new location, then **Allow** LivePepper to connect.

Repeat these steps for each LivePepper branch you want to connect.
