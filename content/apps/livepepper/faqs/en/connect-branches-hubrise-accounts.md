1. Click **Connect to HubRise**.
1. For existing HubRise user profiles with established Accounts and Locations, if prompted login to HubRise, then:

- Select the HubRise **Account** and **Location** to connect your LivePepper Branch to, then click **Allow**. If you have created multiple customer lists or catalogs on HubRise, you will be promoted to click **Next** then select from the **Customer List** or the **Catalog** to connect your Branch to.

- If the corresponding HubRise **Account** and **Location** is not available, select **Create a new location** to connect your LivePepper Branch to a new HubRise Location. If you select this method, fill-in the required fields to create the new location, then **Allow** LivePepper to connect.
