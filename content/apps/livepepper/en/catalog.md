Once your LivePepper site is connected with a HubRise account, customer and order information will be pushed into HubRise automatically. To properly process orders from LivePepper to your EPOS, product ref codes are required for each and every item in the menu, including product variants, toppings and options as well as ingredients, product sizes and deals. 

For a perfect product ref code mapping, you can import your EPOS product catalog into LivePepper. Refer to your connected EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to verify that the EPOS product catalog can be pushed into HubRise. If it cannot, you will need to map product ref codes manually, see [Product](/apps/livepepper/map-ref-codes#product).

## Catalog Import

If you have already pulled your products from your EPOS or other connected app to HubRise, the entire catalog can be imported from HubRise. This will include:

- Products with variants, options, prices, within their respective product categories.
- Deals.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Importing a catalog from HubRise will replace the products in your LivePepper Menu. You can edit the menu in LivePepper after the import. Catalogs cannot be edited in HubRise.
