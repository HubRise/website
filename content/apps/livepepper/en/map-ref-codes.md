Once your LivePepper site is connected with a HubRise account, customer and order information will be pushed into HubRise automatically. For the connection to work with all apps in HubRise, some configuration on the LivePepper side may be needed. This is particularly true for the connection with an EPOS.

To properly process orders from LivePepper to your EPOS, product ref codes are required for each and every item in the menu, including product variants, toppings and options as well as ingredients, product sizes and deals.

In some cases, the EPOS will also require ref codes for payment methods, service types and delivery charges to understand some of the LivePepper functionalities. Always refer to your EPOS documentation on the HubRise website for details.

Your LivePepper menu can either be created directly in LivePepper, or imported from a HubRise catalog.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** It is important for each POS code field available in LivePepper to be mapped with the corresponding EPOS ref codes. If the EPOS ref code is missing, the EPOS will not be unable to correctly process the order.

---

## Catalog Import

If you have already exported your products from your EPOS or other connected app to HubRise, the entire catalog can be imported from HubRise. This will include:

- Products with variants, options, prices, within their respective product categories.
- Deals.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Importing a catalog from HubRise will replace the products in your LivePepper Menu. You can edit the menu in LivePepper after the import. Catalogs cannot be edited in HubRise.

---

To import from a HubRise Catalog into LivePepper:

1. LivePepper must be connected to a HubRise Account and Location. For instructions on this process, see [Connect HubRise](/apps/livepepper/#connect-hubrise/).
1. From LivePepper, click **Menu** > **Import** / **Export**.
1. Scroll down to HubRise connection and click **Import**.
1. Authenticate your credentials and click **Import from HubRise**.
1. The import process will remove your current products and replace them with the ones from your HubRise catalog.

In this example, one of the sizes for the Coke offerings was removed from LivePepper, and then restored when imported from the connected HubRise catalog along with its EPOS ref code.

## Product

If you cannot import the catalog from HubRise, you will need to map product EPOS ref codes manually in LivePepper. The first step is to export a list of EPOS ref codes from your EPOS system. This may be exported as a CSV or Excel file. Whatever format they are exported to, the next step will be to copy those codes into LivePepper.

LivePepper support does support inserting those EPOS ref codes for you, if contracted to do so. See your LivePepper support representative for more information.

### Add EPOS Ref Codes to Products

1. Select the product to update.
2. For each value in the **Price & Availability** section, update the EPOS code.

### Add EPOS Ref Codes to Toppings, Variants, Ingredients, and Options

The process to add EPOS ref codes to toppings, variants, ingredients, and options is the same for product categories and products.

- Product **Category** values include:

  - **Variants**: Variants are available differences in a product. For example: Pizza with thin crust versus pizza with hand tossed crust.
  - **Toppings**: Ingredients that customers can add to their product that are not available by default. For example, adding mushrooms to a cheeseburger. Toppings can be set at the product category or the product level.
  - **Options**: Options are differences in how products are delivered. For example: Adding utensils, sauces, cutting a pizza in squares instead of triangles, etc.

- **Products** values and attributes include:
  - **Ingredients**: Default ingredients within a recipe that customers can remove from their product. For example: Cheeseburger without the pickles.
  - **Price & Availability**: The options made available to the customer, usually in the form of sizes. For example: an 8" pizza versus a 12‚Äù pizza.
  - **Toppings**: Ingredients set at the product category or the product level.

To update the EPOS code for each product ingredient:

1. Select the product.
1. Select the **Ingredients** row.
1. Select the ingredient to update.

   1. From the dropdown select whether the Toppings apply to **All menu** items, or all products in a category.
   2. Click **Use POS codes above**. If the toppings share the same cost and availability, those options can be checked as well.
