To receive LivePepper orders correctly on your EPOS, you need to configure ref codes for each item in the catalog, including toppings and options, ingredients, skus and deals. In some cases, the EPOS also requires ref codes for payment methods, service types and delivery charges. Refer to your EPOS documentation on the HubRise website for details.

This page explains how to configure ref codes in LivePepper. Some EPOS solutions offer the ability to export the menu to HubRise, allowing you to populate your LivePepper menu automatically with the correct ref codes. For more details, see [Pulling and Pushing the Menu](/apps/livepepper/menu).

## Products and Skus

Each product has one or more skus. Each sku has a ref code that must be mapped to the corresponding item in your EPOS.

To update the ref code for each sku, follow these steps:

1. From your LivePepper back office, select **My Menu** > **Products**.
2. Select the product to update.
3. For each sku in the **Price & Availability** section, update the ref code under the **POS code** column.
4. Click **Save** to confirm.

At the end of the process, you can verify that all products have been mapped using the **Missing POS codes** custom action in LivePepper. For more information, see [Verify Product Mapping](/apps/livepepper/troubleshooting#verify-product-mapping)
