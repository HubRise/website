For LivePepper orders to be processed by your EPOS, you need to configure ref codes for each item in the menu, including toppings and options, ingredients, product sizes and deals.

Many EPOS solutions connected with HubRise offer the ability to export the menu to HubRise, allowing you to populate your LivePepper menu automatically with the correct ref codes.

If your EPOS cannot push a menu into HubRise, you will need to map ref codes manually, see [Map Ref Codes](/apps/livepepper/map-ref-codes). Refer to your connected EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to verify.

## Pulling the Menu

To be able to pull your menu into LivePepper, you should populate a HubRise catalog first. Refer to your connected EPOS documentation on the HubRise website for details.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Pulling a HubRise catalog will replace all your current products in LivePepper. This action cannot be reverted.
