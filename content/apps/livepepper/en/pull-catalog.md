For LivePepper orders to be processed by your EPOS, it is essential to assign ref codes to each menu item, including skus, toppings, options, ingredients, and deals.

Some EPOS systems enable menu export to HubRise, facilitating the automatic population of your LivePepper menu with the correct ref codes. However, if your EPOS does not support menu push to HubRise, you will need to manually map ref codes, as described in [Map Ref Codes](/apps/livepepper/map-ref-codes). Consult your EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to verify.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Make sure to associate ref codes to every product and option in your catalog. LivePepper will not pull a HubRise catalog missing any ref codes.
