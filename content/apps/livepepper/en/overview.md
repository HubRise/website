## Description

LivePepper is an online ordering solution for home delivery and takeaway restaurants.

LivePepper clients are mainly located in France and the UK, but the system operates in multiple international markets in the Americas, mainland Europe, North Africa, Middle East and South Asia. LivePepper can easily be localised for the international market.

LivePepper can create a full site including static marketing pages and online ordering. Restaurants can also incorporate LivePepper’s online ordering module into an existing marketing website. Sites can be customised from a template, or designed from scratch and tailored to the restaurant specifications.

LivePepper comes with a rich palette of features and can answer the needs of the most demanding restaurants and international franchises.

Restaurant managers have complete control over their LivePepper site. They can make changes to their menu, set up promotions, set business hours and vacation periods, delivery times, or other settings to best fit their needs. Data can be exported for analysis. 

## Prerequisites

To establish a connection between LivePepper and HubRise, you must have an existing LivePepper site. A test site can be created from the [LivePepper web site](https://www.livepepper.com). Connecting with HubRise is easy, and can be done in just a few minutes. A HubRise user profile and account can be created from the LivePepper back office at any time.

## Why Connect?

LivePepper can be connected to HubRise for your site and other apps to work as a cohesive whole. It could be your EPOS, your loyalty systems, the kitchen display screen you use or your preferred marketing solution. This allows you to sync your menu, your customer and order information. For more information, see the HubRise [Help](/docs).
