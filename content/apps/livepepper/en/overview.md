## Description

LivePepper is a comprehensive online and mobile ordering solution, catering to the needs of the most demanding home delivery and takeaway restaurants and chains.

While most of LivePepper's clients are based in France and the UK, the system functions across various international markets, including the Americas, mainland Europe, North Africa, Middle East, and South Asia.

Equipped with an extensive range of features, LivePepper can either create a website including static marketing pages and online ordering, or integrate its online ordering module into an existing marketing website. These websites can be customised from a template or designed from scratch, according to the restaurant's graphical charter and specifications. Restaurant managers maintain full control over their LivePepper websites through the back office.
