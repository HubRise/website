## Description

Delicity is a food ordering and delivery service platform available on the App Store and Play Store. Unlike traditional platforms, Delicity does not charge a commission on orders but instead bills a fixed cost per order, along with a delivery cost that is 20% lower than that of independent couriers.

Customers have the option to place their order directly with the restaurant or via the Delicity app, which offers responsible on demand delivery services, with better compensation for delivery workers.

Delicity is present in several major cities in France.


## Integration features

Connecting Delicity to HubRise allows your food ordering and delivery service platform to:

- Push orders into HubRise, including order statuses.
- Pull the menu from a HubRise catalog.

Delicity can be connected to HubRise from the Delicity back office.

## Why connect?

By connecting Delicity to HubRise, your food ordering and service delivery platform can communicate with your other everyday applications.  Send online orders to your EPOS, your connected printer, your kitchen display screen or your inventory management solution. Export your menu into other apps.

Thanks to HubRise, you can synchronise your menu, your customer information and your orders with your EPOS, your online ordering solution, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat), delivery management solutions or delivery services, eMarketing (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, stock management and customer loyalty systems, and more. The number of compatible applications increases every month.  To see which apps you can connect, see our [Apps page](/apps).
