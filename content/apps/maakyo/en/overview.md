## Description

Maakyo is a table ordering solution accessible from a smartphone browser. There is no app to install.

Maakyo provides an online menu linked to the restaurant's POS system. Customers can access the menu by scanning a QR code displayed inside the restaurant or on the tables. They can then place their order and pay via their smartphone.

With Maakyo, you can display your menu in different languages (French, English, Spanish and Portuguese), attach photos to products, and customise the QR codes to reflect your company's image.

Maakyo also offers an integrated Click & Collect system.

## Integration features

Once connected to HubRise, Maakyo can be used to:

- Send orders to HubRise.
- Pull the menu from a HubRise catalog.

Maakyo can be connected to HubRise via the Maakyo back office.
