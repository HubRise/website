## Connect TASK

Only the TASK support team can connect your EPOS to HubRise.

To connect TASK to HubRise, proceed as follows:

1. Grant TASK access to your HubRise account. For more information, see [Grant Access to TASK Support](#give-access).
1. Contact the TASK support team who will establish the connection to HubRise. For more information, see [Contact TASK Support](#contact).

## Grant Access to TASK Support {#give-access}

To connect TASK, you need to grant TASK support access to your HubRise account. This will also allow TASK support to troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.

To grant access to TASK, proceed as follows:

1. From the HubRise back office, select **SETTINGS** in the left-hand menu.
1. In the **Permissions** section, enter `support@tasksoftware.com` and select **Manager** in the drop-down list of roles.
1. Click the **+** icon to grant TASK support access to your account.

Adding a user is the recommended way to grant access to a third party to your HubRise account or location. Sharing passwords is not recommended for security reasons. For more information on permissions, see the [Permissions](/docs/permissions) help page.

## Contact TASK Support {#contact}

To request the connection of your EPOS, contact TASK support by email at support@tasksoftware.com. You can include support@hubrise.com in copy for a coordinated follow-up between our two teams.

Include in your request the name of your HubRise account, its HubRise identifier and the location to connect. For more information, see [Location Name and ID](/docs/locations#location-name-and-id).

## Disconnect TASK

To disconnect TASK from HubRise, contact TASK support.

If you need to temporarily stop sending orders from your TASK EPOS into HubRise, you can block the connection between TAKS and HubRise instead. For more information, see [Block or Disconnect App](/docs/connections#block-or-disconnect).
