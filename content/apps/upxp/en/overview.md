## Description

UPXP offers an innovative loyalty solution based on cryptocurrency. UPXP rewards customers who order and book on their restaurant's website by paying them UPXP cryptocurrency, which can be used in other businesses.

UPXP is the first cryptocurrency entirely dedicated to restaurateurs. It is a community project, whose mission is to reward customers rather than banks and intermediaries.

## Integration Features

Connecting UPXP to HubRise allows your loyalty management solution to :

- Pull orders from HubRise, including order status.
- Pull customer information from HubRise

UPXP can be connected to HubRise from the UPXP back office.

## Why Connect?

The number of compatible applications increases every month. To see which apps you can connect, see our [Apps page](/apps).
