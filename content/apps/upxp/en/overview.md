## Description

UPXP offers an innovative loyalty solution based on cryptocurrency. UPXP rewards customers who order and book directly from partner restaurant websites in UPXP cryptocurrency, which can be used across the UPXP ecosystem.

UPXP is the first cryptocurrency dedicated to restaurateurs and hoteliers. It is a community project, whose mission is to reward customers rather than intermediary applications. UPXP connects its users directly with points of sale without commission.

## Integration Features

Connecting UPXP to HubRise allows your loyalty management solution to:

- Pull orders from HubRise, including order status.
