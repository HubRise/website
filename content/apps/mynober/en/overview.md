## Description

MynOber is an ordering solution for restaurants and retail stores. MynOber back-office includes a lightweight and easy-to-use EPOS.

With MynOber, customers can order online from their smartphone or download the MynOber mobile application. From the application, customers can call a waiter, request the bill, pay online and view their order history. They can also receive notifications when their order is ready.

MynOber also offers self ordering kiosks.

MynOber is available in several European countries. It is not yet available in France.

## Why Connect?

Connecting your MynOber solution to HubRise allows you to receive MynOber orders directly in your EPOS or Kitchen Display Screen also connected with HubRise. Additionally, when used as an EPOS, MynOber allows you to connect online ordering solutions and food platforms.
