Connecting MynOber Cloud to HubRise can be done with a few simple steps.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you do not have a HubRise account yet, register on our [Signup Page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup). It only takes a minute!

## 1. Enable HubRise on MynOber Cloud

As a first step, the HubRise integration must be enabled on your MynOber Cloud account.

Contact MynOber Support at [support@mynober.nl](mailto:support@mynober.nl) and ask them to activate the HubRise module in your back office.

## 2. Connect MynOber Cloud

To connect MynOber Cloud to HubRise, follow these steps.

1. Log in to your [MynOber Cloud account](https://cloud.mynober.nl/).
1. Select the location you want to connect from the list.
1. Click **External tools** > **HubRise**.
1. Click **Connect to HubRise**.
1. Click **Allow** to grant MynOber Cloud permission to access the location of your restaurant registered in HubRise. For accounts with multiple locations, expand the **Choose location** section to select the correct one first, and then click **Allow**.

After these steps, you will be redirected to the HubRise module in the MynOber Cloud back office.
You can verify that the connection was successful by checking the HubRise account name, location name and ID, and catalog name and ID displayed on the page.

## 3. Configure Your Preferences

After connecting the app, you need to configure how you want to use MynOber Cloud.

- To push MynOber orders to HubRise, activate the **Online Ordering** toggle.
- To receive HubRise orders on your EPOS connected to MynOber Cloud, activate the **EPOS** toggle.

You can also select both options at the same time.

## 4. Map Products to Ref Codes

If you receive MynOber orders on a third party EPOS connected to HubRise, you need to map all the products in your MynOber menu to their corresponding ref codes. This ensures that your EPOS can identify every item correctly.

To learn how to map ref codes on MynOber Cloud, see [Map Ref Codes](/apps/mynober/map-ref-codes).
