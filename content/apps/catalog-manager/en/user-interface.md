## Catalogs Page

When you open Catalog Manager from the **CONNECTIONS** page in the HubRise back office, you see the list of catalogs available in your account on the **Catalogs** page.
To edit an existing catalog, click **Open** next to the catalog name.

On the **Catalogs** page, you can also perform the following actions:

- Create a new catalog
- Duplicate an existing catalog
- Delete a catalog

For more information, see [Catalogs](/apps/catalog-manager/catalogs).

## Catalog Editing Flow

Editing a catalog is a complex task that often requires multiple iterations.
Catalog Manager is designed to simplify this process with its modular interface.

When you edit a catalog, you typically perform the following steps:

1. You edit the basic information about your products, including ref codes, prices, and images.
2. If needed, you create multiple variants of the catalog, for example to support different prices and availabilities on different delivery platforms.
3. You preview how the catalog appears as a whole to verify that everything is as expected.

The **Edit**, **Grid**, and **Preview** views in Catalog Manager let you perform these actions in an iterative way.

## The Edit View

To create and edit your catalog items, use the **Edit** view in Catalog Manager.
From the **Edit** view, you can create and manage products, options, deals, discounts, and charges.

## The Grid View

After you create your products, options, and deals, you can review them from the **Grid** view, where they are presented in a tabular form for easier comparison.
The **Grid** view also lets you create and manage variants of your catalog, to control availability and prices for different platforms.

## The Preview View

When your catalog is complete, you can preview it from the **Preview** view.
The **Preview** view lets you navigate your product in a similar way to food delivery platforms.
This is a simple but powerful way to check for mistakes in your products and verify that everything is correct before submitting your catalog to your connected apps.
