Catalogs on HubRise can be pulled from your EPOS and pushed into other apps you use every day, online ordering solutions, table ordering apps or digital menus, food ordering and delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat), operations and inventory management solutions, reporting dashboards, Kitchen Display Screens, and more. 

Catalog Manager has the following features:

- Automatically create catalogs and product details using catalogs pulled from your EPOS or your other apps connected to HubRise.
- Edit catalogs with additional information, such as options, pictures and descriptions.
- Option to create catalogs and product details manually, from scratch.

Catalog Manager is a cloud based solution, available anywhere and on any device, computers, tablets and smartphones.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This is version 1 of Catalog Manager.  The next release will include a feature that allows you to create a Catalog at an account level and then have different prices and product availability at a location or channel level.

Also, for catalogs that are pushed from an EPOS, any changes made in the EPOS will be highlighted in the Catalog manager so that the business owner can decide if this change should be applied to any of the locations / channels the catalog is used for.
