  description: Instructions on how to create Catalogs in Catalog Manager. Synchronise catalogs between your EPOS and your apps.

A **Catalog** is simply a container for your products and their associated details. Catalogs are stored in Hubrise and managed using Catalog Manager.  

There are several ways you can create a catalog on HubRise:

- From an EPOS, or another app connected to HubRise
- From an online ordering system or food ordering platform
- From the **SETTINGS** page in your HubRise back office
- Using the Catalog Manager app

## Create a Catalog from Another App

Some EPOS solutions allow you to push your product catalog or menu into a HubRise catalog. Same for some online ordering solutions or food ordering and delivery platforms. You can then use Catalog Manager to augment the details for your product items by adding photos or more detailed descriptions.

For information on how to export your product catalog or menu into a HubRise catalog, refer to your EPOS or other app documentation on the HubRise website [Apps page](https://www.hubrise.com/apps).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Pushing a menu from your EPOS or other app into a HubRise catalog will replace all the items in the existing catalog. Some apps will push the updated menu automatically with every menu update.
