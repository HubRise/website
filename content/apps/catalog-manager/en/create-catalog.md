A **Catalog** is simply a container for your products and their associated details. There are 3 ways you can create a catalog:

1. From an EPOS
2. From an Online Ordering System or Food Ordering Platform
3. Using Catalog Manager

## Create a Catalog from an EPOS

Some EPOS solutions allow you to push your menu to a Hubrise catalog. You can then use Catalog Manager to augment the details for your product items by adding photos or more detailed descriptions.

For information on how to export a menu to a Hubrise catalog, see the documentation for your EPOS.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Exporting a menu from your EPOS into a Hubrise catalog will replace all the items in the existing catalog.
