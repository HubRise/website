Options are additional items which customers can add to a product when ordering. When you create a product, you can choose to create a relationship between the product and an Options List. The Options List needs to be created before you can relate it to a product item. Options List might differ from one product variation to another; for example, additional toppings on a medium pizza could be cheaper and different than those offered on a large pizza.

When viewing Option Lists, you can see the number of SKUs or products that the Option List is used in. This helps you track of which options are used in which products.

## Create Option Lists

Option Lists can be added to the base product, if there are no variations, or to each variation when these are present.

The Options List needs to be created before you can relate it to a product item. To create an Options List, click **Options Lists** in the left hand side menu panel, then select **New option list**. The following information is required:

- Name
- Minimum number of options a customer can select from the option list.
- Maximum number of options a customer can select from the option list.
- For each option, enter a **Name**, **Price**, **Ref code** and flag the **Default** option.

Keep in mind that and Options Lists are related to specific products, or product variations, so it is useful to name your Options List appropriately. For example, for a medium pizza variation you may have three cheese options which you would include in an Options List called `Cheese - Medium Pizza`.

After you have created one or more Option Lists, you can add them to your products:

1. Select the tab for the variation that you want to add options to, for example `10inch Classic`, then click **Attach option list**. You can now select from any previously added Option Lists.
1. For each of the product variations, click **Attach option list** and select the appropriate Options List.
