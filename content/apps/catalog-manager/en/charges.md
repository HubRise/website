  description: Instructions on how to create and edit Charges in Catalog Manager. Synchronise catalogs between your EPOS and your apps.
---

Charges are flat fees that you can apply to a total purchase, such as delivery fees, tips or other costs.

Charges are not exported to food delivery platforms.
Charges are typically very specific to each platform, and not always supported.
For more information about the charges supported in a certain platform, see the app's documentation on the HubRise website.

Set up charges directly in the food platform back-office.
When you export a catalog to your connected platform, Catalog Manager does not delete charges already set up, so you only need to set up charges once.

After the charge is created, you can add the details.
