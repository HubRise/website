  description: Instructions on how to preview your Catalog in Catalog Manager. Synchronise catalogs between your EPOS and your apps.
---

Before you save your catalog and you upload it to HubRise, you can preview its structure and its items from the **Preview** view.
The **Preview** view shows your catalog in a similar way to most food delivery platforms, so you can test how your customers will interact with your catalog.

While you review your catalog, pay attention to images, product names, options, and prices, as these play an important role in the customers' experience.

When you are ready to push your updated catalog to HubRise, click **Save**.
