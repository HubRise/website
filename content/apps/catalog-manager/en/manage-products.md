A **Catalog** contains products, deals, discounts and charges.  The product items themselves contain details about the products, including variations and optional extras.  Managing this information in a central place is one of the key objectives of Catalog Manager.

## Create a Product

To create a product, select the category where the product should be located, click on **New product** and enter a descriptive name for the product.

Once you've created the new product, you can add details to it and relate it to optional items and deals.

### Add or Edit Product Details

1. In the **Description** field enter the product description.
2. Add one or more **Photos** of the product by clicking on the **Add** icon.
3. If the product has variations that a customer needs to choose from, tick the **multiple SKU** check box.  You will then need to enter the SKU, **Price** and **Ref code** for each variation.  If there are no variations, then you can enter the price and ref code.

### Add or Edit Option Lists

Option Lists can be added to the base product (if there are no variations), or to each variation when these are present.

1. Select the tab for the variation that you want to add options to, then click **Attach Option List**.  You can now select from any previously added Option Lists
2. For each of the product variations, lick **Attach Option List** and select the appropriate Options List.
