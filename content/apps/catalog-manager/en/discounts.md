Discounts are percentage or amount discounts that can be applied on a total purchase, as opposed to a specific product item.

Unlike deals, discounts are not exported to food delivery platforms.
Discounts are typically very specific to each platform, and not always supported.
For more information about the discounts supported in a certain platform, see the app's documentation on the HubRise website.

Set up discounts directly in the food platform back-office.
When you export a catalog to your connected platform, Catalog Manager does not delete discounts already set up, so you only need to set up discounts once.
