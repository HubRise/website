Discounts are percentage or amount discounts that can be applied on a total purchase, as opposed to a specific product item.

## Which Apps Support Discounts?

Unlike deals, discounts are typically very specific to each app, and not always supported. To check if a certain app supports discounts, see the app's documentation on the HubRise website.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Discounts are not exported to food delivery platforms, they are managed directly in the platform's back office.
