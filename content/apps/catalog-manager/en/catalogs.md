  description: Instructions on how to create Catalogs in Catalog Manager. Synchronise catalogs between your EPOS and your apps.
---

A **Catalog** is a container for your products and their associated details. Catalogs are stored in HubRise and managed using Catalog Manager.

Catalogs can be created globally across all locations, or at a specific location level. For more information, refer to the HubRise Help page [Accounts](https://www.hubrise.com/docs/account) and [Locations](https://www.hubrise.com/docs/locations). At one location, you may, for example, create one catalog that imports products from your EPOS and synchronises with an online ordering system. At another location, you may create a catalog which is manually maintained and is used only to populate and maintain an online menu.
You can have also have multiple catalogs on the same location.

## Create a Catalog

To create a catalog in Catalog Manager, in the **Catalogs** page, click **New catalog** and enter a name. After you create the new catalog, you can add categories, products, options, deals, discounts and charges directly in Catalog Manager.

Alternatively, you can create a catalog from the **SETTINGS** page in your HubRise back office. For more information, refer to the HubRise Help page [Add a Catalog](https://www.hubrise.com/docs/catalog#add-a-catalog).

## Catalog Actions

You can **Rename**, **Duplicate** an existing catalog, or **Delete** existing catalogs using the Catalog Manager **Actions** dropdown.

## Duplicate a Catalog

Duplicating a catalog can be useful if you want to create a new catalog based on an existing one, or to make a backup of your catalog.

To duplicate a catalog, follow these steps:

1. In Catalog Manager, go to the **Catalogs** page.
1. Find the catalog you want to duplicate, expand the **Actions** list, then select **Duplicate**.
1. Provide a name for the new catalog, then click **Duplicate**.

Use clearly identifiable names for your catalogs. For example, if you create a catalog for Uber Eats, you could name it **Uber Eats**. If you create a backup catalog, include **Backup** or **Do not edit!** in the name, to make it clear that it should not be edited.
