We recommend using Google Chrome. On mobile devices, make sure to disable the auto-lock in your display settings.

To access Catalog Manager, log in to [HubRise](https://manager.hubrise.com), select **CONNECTIONS** then **Open** next to the Catalog Manager app. Catalog Manager will open in a new browser tab.

You can save the Catalog Manager Link as a favorite in your internet browser for daily ease of access. To terminate your Catalog Manager session, close the browser tab.
