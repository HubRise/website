There are two ways to populate a catalog on HubRise:

- You can populate a catalog manually using Catalog Manager. For more information, see [Catalog Manager](/apps/catalog-manager/overview).

- You can also push a catalog into HubRise from an EPOS, an online ordering solution, a food ordering platform, or any other app connected to your HubRise account. After a push, you might need to rearrange or improve your products by adding photos or more detailed descriptions using Catalog Manager.

To check if an app supports the catalog push feature, refer to its documentation on the HubRise website [Apps page](/apps).
