Glovo Bridge can be connected to HubRise from the HubRise back office.

## Why Connect?

Connecting your Glovo online restaurant to HubRise allows you to receive Glovo orders directly in your EPOS, your Kitchen Display System or your Delivery Management System also connected with HubRise. You will be able to manage Glovo orders alongside other orders, using tools you use every day. Glovo orders will flow through your existing setup, as all other orders already do.

Thanks to HubRise, you can synchronise your menu, your customer information and your orders with your EPOS, your online ordering solution, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat), delivery management solutions or delivery services, eMarketing (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, inventory management and customer loyalty systems, and more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To see which apps you can connect, see our [Apps page](/apps).

## Prerequisites
