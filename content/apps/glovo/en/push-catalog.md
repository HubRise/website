With Glovo Bridge, you can push your HubRise catalog into your Glovo store with a single click.

You can also configure the bridge to push your catalog into Glovo every time it is updated on HubRise. For more information, see [Catalog](/apps/glovo/configuration#catalog).

This page explains how to push your catalog, and what information is sent to Glovo.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You can update your Glovo catalog at most 5 times per day.

## Populate a HubRise Catalog

To update your menu in Glovo, you should have a HubRise catalog first. Many apps connected with HubRise, including EPOS solutions, offer the ability to push their menu into HubRise. Refer to your EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to verify.

Alternatively, you can populate a HubRise catalog by pulling your menu from Uber Eats.

For more information on HubRise catalogs, see [Catalogs](/docs/catalog/).

## Manual Catalog Push

Once your catalog is populated on HubRise, you can push it manually to your Glovo store by following these steps:

1. Log in to your [HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com).
1. Select the HubRise account and location connected with your Glovo store.

### Option Lists and Options

Glovo Bridge maps option lists and options one-to-one to Glovo.

### Deals

Glovo Bridge maps HubRise deals to products with attributes in Glovo. However, Glovo only supports one level of options. Therefore, if products in a deal has associated options, Glovo Bridge will ignore those options.

### Categories

- `ref`: The ref code of the category
- `image_ids`: The images of the category

The order in which categories and products appear on HubRise is maintained on Glovo.

- `sku.ref`: The ref of the sku, which will be passed along in orders
- `description`: The description of the product
- `sku.price`: The price of the sku

For more information about skus in the HubRise catalog, see [Skus](/developers/api/catalog-management/#skus).

### Options

For every option list in the catalog, Glovo Bridge sends the following information to Glovo:

- `name`: The name of the option list
- `ref`: The ref code of the option list
- `min_selections`: The minimum number of options that customers can select
- `max_selections`: The maximum number of options that customers can select

For every option in an option list, Glovo Bridge sends the following information to Glovo:

### Deals

For each deal in the catalog, Glovo Bridge creates a Glovo product with the following details:

- `category_ref`: If empty, Glovo Bridge creates a default category in Glovo called "Offers".
- `ref`: The ref code of the deal becomes the ref of the product, preceded by `DEAL-`. For example, for a deal with ref code `abc123`, Glovo Bridge creates a Glovo product with plu `DEAL-abc123`.
- `lines`: For each object in the array, Glovo Bridge creates an attribute group, with `lines.name` as the name.
