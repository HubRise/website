You can use PrestaShop Bridge to push your HubRise catalog directly into your PrestaShop store with a single click.
Also, you can update the availability of your items on PrestaShop every time this changes on HubRise.

This page explains how you can push your catalog, what information is sent to PrestaShop, and how you can update your inventory availability.


## Push Your Catalog

PrestaShop Bridge lets you push your HubRise catalog to PrestaShop.
You can let PrestaShop Bridge push your catalog automatically every time it is updated on HubRise, or manually push it when needed.

### Populate a HubRise Catalog

To be able to push your catalog into PrestaShop, you must populate a HubRise catalog first. Many apps connected with HubRise, including EPOS solutions, offer the ability to export the catalog to HubRise. Refer to your EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to verify.

For more information on HubRise catalogs, see [Catalogs](/docs/catalog/).

### Manual Catalog Push

Once your catalog is populated on HubRise, you can manually push it to your PrestaShop store by following these steps.

1. Log in to your HubRise account.

1. Open the **CONNECTIONS** page, then select **PrestaShop Bridge** from the list of connected apps.
1. In PrestaShop Bridge, select the **Actions** tab, then click **Push catalog**.

When you push your catalog, PrestaShop Bridge creates the products that do not yet exist in PrestaShop.
PrestaShop Bridge does not delete products.

## Technical Reference for Catalog Push

The following sections describe in detail how HubRise catalogs are mapped to PrestaShop.

### Categories

PrestaShop Bridge maps HubRise categories one-to-one to categories of products on PrestaShop.

The category name and description are sent to PrestaShop, however the ref code is ignored, since PrestaShop does not support ref codes for categories.

### Products and Skus

HubRise products and skus are mapped one-to-one to PrestaShop products and combinations.
For more information about products in HubRise catalogs, see [Products](/developers/api/catalog-management/#products).

For every HubRise `product` object, PrestaShop Bridge sends the following information to PrestaShop:

- `name`: The name of the product
- `description`: The description of the product
- `image_ids`: The IDs of the images associated with the product
- `skus`: The list of skus attached to the product

For every sku in the `skus` array, PrestaShop Bridge sends the following information to PrestaShop:

- `ref`: The ref code of the sku, which will be passed along in orders
- `name`: The name of the sku
- `price`: The price of the sku

For more information about skus in the HubRise catalog, see [Skus](/developers/api/catalog-management/#skus).

### Options

Options are not supported on PrestaShop. The options present in your HubRise catalog are ignored and are not sent to PrestaShop.

### Deals and Discounts

Deals and discounts are not supported on PrestaShop. Deals and discounts present in your HubRise catalog are ignored and are not sent to PrestaShop.
