## Description

Spleat the bill is a pay at the table solution for bars and restaurants, allowing customers to pay and share the bill using their smartphone.

To pay their order, customers install the Spleat the bill app. They scan a QR code or manually enter the table number in the app. They then choose the amount they want to pay. The payment is charged to the bank card account they will have registered beforehand.

Spleat the bill communicates with the restaurateur's EPOS solution to automatically close orders that have been paid.

## Integration features

Once connected to HubRise, Spleat the bill can be used to:

- Pull orders from HubRise.
- Pull the menu from a HubRise catalog.

Spleat the bill can be connected to HubRise via the Spleat the bill support line.

## Why connect?

By connecting Spleat the bill to HubRise, your payment solution can communicate with your other everyday applications. Receive orders from your EPOS solution, and close them once they are paid.

Thanks to HubRise, you can synchronise your menu and your customer and order information with your EPOS solution, your online ordering solution, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat), delivery management solutions or delivery services, eMarketing (SMS/emailing) solutions, business intelligence, stock management and customer loyalty systems, and more. The number of compatible applications is constantly increasing. To see which apps you can connect, see our [Apps page](/apps).
