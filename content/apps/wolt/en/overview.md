## Description

Founded in Helsinki, Finland, in 2014, Wolt's mission is to make city life easier by enabling people to discover and enjoy the best their city has to offer, conveniently delivered to their door.

Through the Wolt app and website, clients can browse a wide selection of restaurants and shops, place an order, and have it delivered quickly by a network of independent couriers. The platform also supports pickup orders, allowing users to skip queues and collect their purchases directly. 

Beyond food delivery, Wolt has expanded into retail and grocery logistics, offering same-day delivery of essential goods from major supermarket chains and local stores.

Wolt operates in around 30 countries, with a particularly strong presence across Northern, Central, and Eastern Europe, as well as selected countries in Asia and the Middle East. Wolt joined forces with DoorDash in 2022.
