## Description

Clyo Systems is a software platform that enables centralised management. Designed for restaurants and retail stores, it streamlines various operational aspects through a single interface. The EPOS system consolidates sales management, stock control, loyalty, and kitchen display features. It also includes time-tracking for staff and supports online ordering with Click & Collect services.

Clyo Systems adapts to the changing needs of businesses by enabling native modules, and connecting third-party applications via direct integrations or via HubRise. This modular approach aims to provide efficient management and offer the flexibility merchants need to optimise their operational management and enhance the customer experience.

Clyo Systems complies with the French anti-fraud law of 2018.


## Integration Features

- Pull orders from HubRise, including order status.
