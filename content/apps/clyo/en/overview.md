## Description

Clyo Systems is a software platform that enables centralised management of restaurants and retail stores. It streamlines various operational aspects through a single interface. The EPOS system consolidates sales management, stock control, loyalty, and kitchen display features. It also includes time-tracking for staff and supports online ordering with Click & Collect services.

Clyo Systems adapts to the changing needs of businesses by enabling native modules, and connecting third-party applications via direct integrations or via HubRise. This modular approach aims to provide efficient management and offer the flexibility merchants need to optimise their operational management and enhance the customer experience.

Available in most French-speaking countries, including France, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Belgium, as well as in many French-speaking African countries, especially in Morocco and Algeria.

Clyo Systems complies with the French anti-fraud law of 2018.

## Integration Features

Connecting Clyo Systems to HubRise allows your EPOS to:

- Pull orders from HubRise, including order status.
- Pull customer information from HubRise.
- Push a catalog into HubRise.

Clyo Systems can be connected to HubRise from Clyo's back office.

## Why Connect?

By connecting Clyo Systems to HubRise, your EPOS can communicate with your other everyday applications. Receive orders from your online ordering solution, or food delivery platforms in your EPOS. Push the menu you have in Clyo into your other apps.

With HubRise, you can synchronise your menu, customer information, and orders between your EPOS, your online ordering solution, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat), delivery management solutions or delivery services, eMarketing solutions (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, inventory, and customer loyalty systems, and much more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To discover the apps you can connect, visit our [Apps page](/apps).
