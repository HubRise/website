**IMPORTANT NOTE**: TastyCloud cannot simultaneously have a connection with HubRise, and a direct connection to an EPOS. Once your TastyCloud website is connected to HubRise, your EPOS will necessarily be connected via HubRise. To see available EPOS solutions on HubRise, check our [Apps](/apps) page.

Follow these steps to connect TastyCloud to HubRise:

1. If you have no HubRise Account, create one on the [HubRise Registration page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup).
1. Give support@tastycloud.fr permission to access your HubRise Account as **Manager**. For instructions, see [Add a User Permission](/docs/permissions/#add-a-user).
1. Contact your TastyCloud support representative and share your HubRise Location name and unique identifier. For instance, `Fast Pizza London (e34ss-8)`. They will assist you with the connection. Please refer them to the next section of this page if they need more information on the connection process. 

At this stage, the connection of a HubRise Location to a TastyCloud website can only be performed by TastyCloud's support team, but users will soon be able to do it autonomously.
