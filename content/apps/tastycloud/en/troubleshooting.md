From time to time it may be necessary to troubleshoot certain issues with the connection between TastyCloud or HubRise. Should this need arise, the following information may be helpful.

## Verify Product Mapping

Follow these steps to verify the product mapping:

1. Login to your TastyCloud back office.
1. Open the **Mapping des produits** (Products mapping) page
1. Successively open the 4 sections: **Produits** (Products), **Options** (Options), **QuantitÃ©** (Quantity), and **Menus** (Deals). Make sure that all TastyCloud items are mapped to HubRise by opening the dropdown on the left and checking that it is empty.

For more information, check the [Product Ref Code Mapping](/apps/tastycloud/map-ref-codes/#products-and-options) section.

## Check Order Logs in HubRise

Place a test order on your website to verify the connection between TastyCloud and HubRise.

You should view the test order transmitted to HubRise through the following steps:

1. Login to your HubRise account.
1. Click **Data** > **Orders**. Order will be displayed.
1. Click the new Order to verify the customer and order information is accurate.
1. The **Logs** section will contain the detailed JSON records of the communication between TastyCloud and HubRise. For more information on how to read these logs, see [Understanding Logs in HubRise](/docs/hubrise-logs).

If the order is not visible, [check your connection with HubRise](/apps/tastycloud/connect-hubrise). If the order details are incorrect, [verify the Product Mapping](/apps/tastycloud/map-ref-codes/). If none of this works, [contact TastyCloud support](#tastycloud-support).

## TastyCloud Support

The TastyCloud support team can be contacted at [support@tastycloud.fr](mailto:support@tastycloud.fr) for issues with the configuration of the connection.
