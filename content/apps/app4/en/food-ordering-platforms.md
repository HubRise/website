  title: Food Ordering Platforms | App4 | HubRise
  description: Integrating App4 with food ordering platforms requires you to specify particular ref codes in the configuration page of the delivery platform bridge.
---

With HubRise, you can receive orders from Deliveroo, Just Eat, Uber Eats and other food platforms in App4.

This page describes the settings to use to connect food ordering platforms to App4.

For more information, check the documentation of these platforms in our [Apps page](/apps/food-ordering-platforms).

## Service Type Refs {#service-type-refs}

App4 displays the ref codes configured in the Service Type fields in the order notes. You can leave these ref codes empty, or use any value that will help you identify the source and service type of an order.

For example, you can use `Deliveroo` for all Deliveroo orders, or differentiate between delivery and collection orders with `Deliveroo delivery` and `Deliveroo collection`. You can also include your restaurant name in the ref code, such as `Deliveroo My Restaurant`, if you operate multiple brands and want to differentiate between them.

## Deliveroo

To receive Deliveroo orders in App4, you first need to connect Deliveroo Bridge, an app included in your HubRise subscription. For more information about Deliveroo Bridge, see the [Deliveroo Bridge documentation](/apps/deliveroo/overview).

In the Deliveroo Bridge configuration page, use the following settings:

| Section        | Name                                  | Ref code                                          |

| Order statuses | Mark orders as Accepted               | `when their HubRise status changes to "Received"` |

## Just Eat

Just Eat offers two APIs:

- The Flyt API is used on the Just-Eat.co.uk, Just-Eat.ie, Menulog and SkipTheDishes platforms, and for chains on other markets. This API allows you to synchronise the orders and the menu.
- The Takeaway API, the older one, is used for independents on other markets. It allows you to receive orders, but not to send the menu.

If you are not sure which API to use, contact support@hubrise.com.
