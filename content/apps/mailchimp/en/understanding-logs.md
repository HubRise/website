The main page on Mailchimp Bridge shows **Latest operations**, the HubRise requests sent to Mailchimp. The requests from HubRise to the Mailchimp Bridge and the request from Mailchimp Bridge to Mailchimp can be found here.

## Operations table

The **Latest operations** table might contain an **ORDER** and/or a **CUSTOMER** column depending on the configuration options chosen. For more information, see [Configurations Options](/apps/mailchimp/configuration/#configuration-options).

Operations which contain an entry in the **Customer** or the **Order** column, show where a customer's details was sent to Mailchimp. Other operations might be when an export of all HubRise customers is sent to Mailchimp.

You might also find automated **System request** entries. These can be ignored.

When clicked each operation opens and displays all the logs of the API requests exchanged between HubRise and Mailchimp via the Mailchimp Bridge. Information about each API request is contained in three columns:

- **Time**: The time the operation took place.
- **Direction**: The direction of the operation, i.e. whether it was data sent from HubRise to Mailchimp Bridge or whether it was data sent from Mailchimp Bridge to Mailchimp.
- **Status**: The status of the request. The value `OK` confirms that the request was successfully sent. The value `401` or any other value showing in red means that the request has failed.

Each log, when opened, is divided into two parts: Request and Response. The former displays the information sent in the request, and the latter the response received.

## Request to Mailchimp

In the case of a request made from Mailchimp Bridge to Mailchimp, the data is transferred as an URL Encoded Form. In this case the keys and values are encoded in key-value tuples separated by '&', with a '=' between the key and the value. Non-alphanumeric characters in both keys and values are percent encoded: this is the reason why this type is not suitable to use with binary data.

The request made from Mailchimp Bridge to Mailchimp contains the following data fields:

- `email_address`: The email address of the customer which is added to Mailchimp.
- `status`: Indicates whether the customer is subscribed to receive messages through the Mailchimp platform.
- `merge_fields`: Indicates which fields are merged on Mailchimp.
- `FNAME`: The first name of the customer.
- `LNAME`: The last name of the customer.

The response indicates what values were transferred to Mailchimp from Mailchimp Bridge and if the transfer was successful. A status code of 200 indicates that the transfer was successful, whereas other codes will indicate that the transfer was unsuccessful. In the case of an unsuccessful transfer, an error message will also be provided in the relevant response.

The response will contain the following data fields:

- `id`: The unique identifier of the response.
- `email_address`: The email address of the customer.
- `unique_email_id`: The unique identifier of the customer's email address.
- `status`: Indicates whether the customer is subscribed to receive communications through the Mailchimp platform.
- `FNAME`: The first name of the customer.
- `LNAME`: The last name of the customer.
