## Connect Mailchimp to HubRise

To connect your Mailchimp account to your HubRise account:

1. Open you HubRise back office, click the down arrow <InlineImage width="28" height="21">![Down arrow icon](../images/009-arrow.jpg)</InlineImage> next to **Location** to select the location you want to connect. For help, check the HubRise User Guide > [Accounts](/docs/account) and [Locations](/docs/locations).

1. Select **CONNECTIONS** > **View available apps**.

1. Scroll down and select **Mailchimp Bridge** from the list of apps.

1. On the popup, click **Connect**.

1. Allow Mailchimp permission to access your location registered in HubRise. For accounts with multiple locations, expand the **Choose location** section to select the correct one and click on **Allow**. If you have multiple customer lists, you will also be prompted to confirm the one you wish to use.

1. You will be redirected to the Mailchimp login screen. Here you will login to your Mailchimp account. If you don't have a Mailchimp account, you will need to create one on [Mailchimp's homepage](www.mailchimp.com).

1. Once logged in, you will be asked whether you want to authorise HubRise. Select **Allow**.

1. After authorisation, you will be taken to the configuration page. You can close the window and log back into your HubRise back office. Select **CONNECTIONS** in the left navigation pane. You will see that your HubRise location is now connected to Mailchimp.

Once your HubRise location is connected to Mailchimp, customer information is pushed to Mailchimp automatically.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: For every location in HubRise, you will need to perform a new connection to Mailchimp. Once all connections are set, you need to configure Mailchimp Bridge for contacts to be synced. For more information, see [Configuration](/apps/mailchimp/configuration).
