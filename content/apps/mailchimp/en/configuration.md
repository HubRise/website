1. In the configuration section you have three options:

   - **Mailchimp account**: This option indicates which Mailchimp account is connected to your HubRise location.

   - **Mailchimp list**: This option indicates the Mailchimp Audience where the customers are exported to. In the drop-down list, you can select the Mailchimp audience to use. The selected audience also appears in the far right hand side of the Mailchimp header, immediately below the name of your business.
