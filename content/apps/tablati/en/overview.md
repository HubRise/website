## Description

Tablati enhances the restaurant eat-in experience by providing a user-friendly solution for autonomous ordering and payment via QR code. Designed to improve operational efficiency and simplify service, it allows customers to:

- Access an interactive digital menu without downloading any application.
- Place orders directly from their smartphone.
- Split and pay the bill quickly and easily.

Tablati is simple to use and designed for customer autonomy:

- **Autonomous table ordering**: Customers scan a QR code placed on the table to view the digital menu in their browser, no app installation required.
- **Multilingual menu**: The menu is available in several languages to accommodate a wide range of customers.
- **Fast and secure payment**: Customers pay directly from their smartphone, with multiple payment options available.
- **Tip management simplified**: Tablati enables tipping via predefined suggestions (5%, 10%, 15%) or a free amount.
- **Google review collection**: After settling the bill, customers are invited to leave a Google review, helping to strengthen the restaurant’s online presence.
- **Loyalty programme**: Tablati helps retain customers through Miamus, a built-in reward system offering discounts and special deals to encourage return visits.
- **Comprehensive back office for managing your business**: Dashboard, accounting, menu creation, and review management.
