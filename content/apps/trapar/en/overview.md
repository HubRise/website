## Description

Trapar is a last-mile delivery management solution designed for restaurants, grocers, and retailers engaged in self-delivery. Trapar handles orders received through phone, businesses' own online ordering websites, and various marketplaces as well as food ordering and delivery platforms such as Just Eat, Deliveroo, and Uber Eats. 

It offers an app and interface for managing delivery activities in real-time, from any location.
