## Description

Zelty Bridge is an application developed by HubRise that enables your Zelty EPOS to exchange data with your HubRise apps ecosystem.

Zelty is a comprehensive EPOS solution designed for traditional table-service restaurants, quick-service establishments, franchises, and chains. The interface allows you to manage your business in real-time from anywhere. It adapts to businesses' specific needs through various modules, a table map, a kitchen display system, customer management, deliveries and booking, online ordering, and much more.

Used by 4,000 restaurants, this French solution on the market since 2015 allows you to centralise all sales channels on a single iPad screen. Order taking and payment can be done from the counter register, a mobile iPhone, the website, self-service kiosks, a QR code, or delivery platforms. The remotely accessible back office allows you to modify menus, track orders in real-time, analyse performance, and manage teams from any device.

It is an open solution that integrates with customers' existing tools, either directly or via HubRise. As an independent and self-funded company, Zelty offers France-based customer support, available 7/7 by phone, email, or chat.

Zelty complies with the 2018 French Anti-Fraud Act. Its back office is available in French.
