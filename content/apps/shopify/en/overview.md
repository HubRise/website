## Description

Shopify is an e-commerce platform for online and retail point-of-sale systems. Shopify offers online retailers a suite of services including payments, marketing, shipping, analytics and support. It allows businesses to sell their products worldwide by giving them the necessary tools, like language and currency management.

In 2020, it reported having more than 1,000,000 merchants operating in approximately 175 countries worldwide using its platform, from local businesses to worldwide operating ones, like Tesla, Nescafe, or Red Bull.

Shopify also offers developer tools, like a suite of APIs, that would allow you to create applications and themes for your online store. There are also many of them available online on Shopify stores if you want to personalize your e-commerce platform without needing the help of a developer.
