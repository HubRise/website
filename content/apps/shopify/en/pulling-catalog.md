You can use Shopify Bridge to pull your HubRise catalog directly into your Shopify store with a single click.

This page explains how you can pull and update your catalog on Shopify, and what information about HubRise catalogs can be pulled into the platform.

## Populating a HubRise Catalog

To be able to pull your catalog into Shopify, you must populate a HubRise catalog first. Many apps connected with HubRise, including EPOS solutions, offer the ability to export the catalog to HubRise. Refer to your connected EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to verify.

For more information on HubRise catalogs, see [Catalogs](/docs/catalog/).

1. Log in to your HubRise account.
1. Select the location connected with your Shopify store.

## Technical Reference

The following sections describe in detail how HubRise catalogs are mapped to Shopify.

### Categories

Shopify does not support categories. When you upload HubRise products to Shopify, they will not be divided into separate categories.

### Products and Skus

HubRise products and skus are mapped one-to-one to Shopify products and variants.
For more information about products in HubRise catalogs, see [Products](/developers/api/catalog-management/#products).

For every HubRise `product` object, Shopify Bridge pulls the following information into Shopify:

- `name`: The name of the product
- `description`: The description of the product
- `tags`: The tags associated with the product
- `image_ids`: The IDs of the images associated with the product
- `skus`: The list of skus attached to the product

For every sku in the `skus` array, Shopify Bridge pulls the following information into Shopify:

- `ref`: The ref of the sku, which will be passed along in orders         
- `name`: The name of the sku             
- `price`: The price of the sku            

For more information about skus in the HubRise catalog, see [Skus](/developers/api/catalog-management/#skus).

### Options

Options are not supported on Shopify. The options present in your HubRise catalog are ignored and are not pulled into Shopify.

### Deals and Discounts

Deals and discounts are not supported on Shopify. Deals and discounts present in your HubRise catalog are ignored and are not pulled into Shopify.

## Updating Inventory Availability

Every time your HubRise inventory is updated, Shopify Bridge automatically updates the products' availability in your Shopify inventory.
