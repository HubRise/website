## Description

My Lemonade is a table ordering solution. Customers flash the QR code or use the NFC tag placed on the table to access the menu on their smartphone and order. There is nothing to install. Customer can choose to pay directly on the app or with the waiter. The menu can be translated in 11 languages and displays in the customer's smartphone language by default. 

My Lemonade can also be used for click & collect.

My Lemonade includes a back office to update the menu of your restaurant, set promotional periods, edit your settings, and use features like room management, service activation, and presence validation to limit the risk of no-shows and abusive orders. An order management system is available for restaurants without EPOS integration to receive orders and update product availabilities.


## Integration Features

Connecting My Lemonade to HubRise allows your ordering solution to:

- Push orders into HubRise, including order status.
- Push customer information into HubRise.
- Push the menu into a HubRise catalog.
- Pull the menu from a HubRise catalog.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Pulling orders and customer information from HubRise, and synchronising inventory with HubRise will be supported in the future. Contact My Lemonade for more information.
