## Description

My Lemonade is a mobile ordering solution, with which customers are able to view the menu of a restaurant, to order, and optionally to pay, without leaving your table, thanks to QR codes or NFC technologies.

My Lemonade also offers many features to restaurants like, for instance, limiting the risk of no-shows and abusive orders, customizing their promotional periods, or being able to activate or deactivate the service to help your staff absorb peak traffic periods.

A kitchen screen is available to restaurants without EPOS integration to receive orders and update product availabilities.

My Lemonade also offers a web back office so you can customize the menu of your restaurant, edit your settings, and use features like room management, service activation, and presence validation.

## Prerequisites

To establish a connection between My Lemonade and HubRise, you must have an account on both apps.

Connecting My Lemonade to HubRise allows My Lemonade to:

- Pull a catalog from HubRise.

## Why Connect?

Connecting My Lemonade to HubRise allows you to edit your menu, to receive orders directly in your EPOS, and to update product availabilities.
