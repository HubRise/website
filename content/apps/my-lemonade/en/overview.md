## Description

My Lemonade is a mobile web app that is intended for restaurants and their customers.

It allows customers to view the menu, order, and optionally pay, directly from the table of the restaurant. It uses for this purpose QR code or NFC technologies.

My Lemonade also offers many features useful to restaurants like, for instance, limiting the risk of no-shows and abusive orders, customizing their promotional periods, or being able to activate or deactivate the service easily to help their staff absorb peak traffic periods.

On the Android app, a kitchen screen is available to restaurants without POS integration to receive orders, update product availabilities, and generate QR codes.

My Lemonade also offers a web back office to allow restaurants to customize their menu, to edit their settings, and to use features like room management, service activation, and presence validation.
