## Description

My Lemonade is a table or click & collect ordering solution.

When ordering in the restaurant, the customer scans a QR code on the table and accesses the menu from the browser of his or her smartphone, without installing an application.

The customer can also order from outside the restaurant, thanks to click & collect, and pay on the spot or online.

My Lemonade offers an advanced back office, allowing the user to configure the product offer and customise the appearance of the website.

My Lemonade also allows the menu to be translated into 11 different languages, with the default display language being the one of the customer's smartphone.

## Integration Features

Connecting My Lemonade to HubRise allows your online ordering solution to:

- Push orders into HubRise, including order status.
- Push customer information into HubRise.
- Push the menu into a HubRise catalog.
- Pull the menu from a HubRise catalog.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Pulling orders and customer information from HubRise, and synchronising inventory with HubRise will be supported in the future. Contact My Lemonade for more information.
