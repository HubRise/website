## Description

GonnaOrder is an online ordering solution for restaurants. It supports on-site, takeaway and delivery orders.

GonnaOrder provides a back office to edit the menu, attach photos to products, highlight dishes of the day, and translate product descriptions into more than 80 languages. It can also be used to view orders, and inform customers of their order's real-time status.
