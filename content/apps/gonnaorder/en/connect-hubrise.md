## 2. Map Ref Codes

If you use GonnaOrder with an EPOS, you need to map all the products in your GonnaOrder menu to their corresponding ref codes. This ensures that your EPOS can identify every item correctly.

Additionally, some EPOS systems require ref codes for service types, payments, and fees. You can also specify these values from the GonnaOrder back office.

To learn how to map ref codes on GonnaOrder, see [Map Ref Codes](/apps/gonnaorder/map-ref-codes).
