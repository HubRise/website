To connect your Deliveroo stores to HubRise by yourself, enable HubRise directly from the Deliveroo back office, and then connect Deliveroo Bridge to your HubRise location.

To enable HubRise on the Deliveroo back-office, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [Deliveroo back office](https://restaurant-hub.deliveroo.net/).
1. Click **Integrations**.
1. Under **Which POS system do you use?**, enter `HubRise`.
1. Select all the sites you want to connect from the sites' list, then for each site enter the corresponding **Site location ID**.
1. Choose if you want to manage your Deliveroo menu from the EPOS:
   - To update your menu by pushing the HubRise catalog to Deliveroo, select **Yes**. For more information, see [Push Catalog](/apps/deliveroo/push-catalog).
   - To update your menu manually from the Deliveroo back office, select **No**. Make sure all the products in your menu have a PLU code.
1. Confirm that your products have a PLU code.
1. Click **Connect your till (POS)** to confirm.

To complete the connection and start receiving your Deliveroo orders in HubRise, connect Deliveroo Bridge to all HubRise locations you want to associate with Deliveroo stores. For more information, see [Connect Deliveroo Bridge](/apps/deliveroo/connect-hubrise#connect-the-bridge).
