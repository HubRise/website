The Restaurant ID is the unique identifier for your Deliveroo store. It is also referred to as Branch ID, Admin ID, Tablet ID, or Location ID, depending on the context.

To find your Deliveroo Restaurant ID, follow these steps.

## Option 1

From your Deliveroo tablet:

1. Tap the navigation button on the top right of the page.
1. Your ID is the number between brackets, next to the restaurant name.

## Option 2

On your browser:

1. Log in to your [Deliveroo back office](https://restaurant-hub.deliveroo.net/).
1. Go to the **Home** tab, then select the correct location and account from the dropdown menus.
1. Look at the URL of the page, and find the parameter called `branchId`. Your Deliveroo Restaurant ID will be the number after the `=` sign. For example, if the URL is `https://restaurant-hub.deliveroo.net/analytics?branchId=278233&dateRangePreset=last_7_days&orgId=190921`, the Deliveroo Restaurant ID is `278233`.
