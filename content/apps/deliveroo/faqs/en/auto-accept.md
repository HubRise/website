  description: Deliveroo lack of support for tabletless integration, and how to enable auto-accept for your orders.
---

Deliveroo does not currently support tabletless integrations. The Deliveroo tablet needs to be on and connected to receive orders in HubRise.

You can however enable auto-accept to free up staff from managing the tablet, and avoid the risk of orders being rejected. HubRise recommends to enable auto-accept.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Even with auto-accept enabled, you need to keep the tablet turned on to receive orders.

To enable auto-accept, you need to turn it on every day when you open your restaurant. Simply select **Turn on Auto-accept** when you see this page on your tablet:

At any time, you can also turn auto-accept on or off from the **Settings** page on the tablet.
