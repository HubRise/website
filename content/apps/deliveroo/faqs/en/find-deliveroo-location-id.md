To find your Deliveroo Location ID, follow these steps.

## Option 1

From your Deliveroo tablet:

1. Tap the navigation button = on the top right of the page.
1. Your ID is the number between brackets, next to the restaurant name.

## Option 2

On your browser:

1. Log in to your [Deliveroo back office](https://restaurant-hub.deliveroo.net/).
1. Go to the **Home** tab, then select the correct location and account from the dropdown menus.
1. Look at the URL of the page, and find the parameter called `branchId`. Your Deliveroo Location ID will be the number after the "=" sign. For example, if the URL is `https://restaurant-hub.deliveroo.net/analytics?branchId=278233&dateRangePreset=last_7_days&orgId=190921`, the Deliveroo Location ID is `278233`.
