Before you can receive Deliveroo orders in HubRise, the API functionalities need to be activated in your Deliveroo account. Don't worry, HubRise will take care of the process for you.

Contact us at [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com) and include the following information in your email:

- The URL link(s) of your Deliveroo store(s) you wish to connect. For instance, [https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/london/clapham/camile-thai-clapham](https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/london/clapham/camile-thai-clapham).
- The email address you logged in the Deliveroo back office and use to communicate with Deliveroo.
- Your HubRise account and location IDs. If you don't have a HubRise Account, go to the [HubRise Signup Page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup) and follow the instructions. If your restaurant called Fast Pizza is located in Baker Street, your location ID may be Fast Pizza Baker Street z6q31-0.

We will then contact Deliveroo on your behalf to enable the connection and get back to you with the Deliveroo location ID you will need to enter during the setup process.
