**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Deliveroo tablets are currently required to receive orders in HubRise. Auto-accept can be activated. For more information, see [How Can I Auto-Accept Orders?](/apps/deliveroo/faqs/auto-accept/) 
Deliveroo is planning to support tabletless integration in the future.

Deliveroo Bridge can be connected to HubRise from the HubRise back office.

## Why Connect?

Connecting your Deliveroo online restaurant or convenience store to HubRise allows you to receive Deliveroo orders directly in your EPOS or Kitchen Display System also connected with HubRise.
You will be able to manage Deliveroo orders alongside other orders, using your own tools. Deliveroo orders will flow through your existing setup, as all other orders already do.

Via HubRise, synchronise your menu, your customer and order information with online ordering, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat), delivery management, delivery services, eMarketing (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, stock management, loyalty systems, and more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To see which apps you can connect, see our [Apps page](/apps).

## Prerequisites

To establish a connection between Deliveroo and HubRise, your restaurant must be a Deliveroo partner.
