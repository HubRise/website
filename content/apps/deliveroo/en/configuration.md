The configuration page allows you to customise the behaviour of Deliveroo Bridge based on your preferences.
These are divided into different sections for an easier navigation.

## Language

From this section, you can decide which language is used to localise your receipts.

## Service Types

Service types such as delivery by Deliveroo, restaurant delivery or takeaway might require the corresponding ref code entry. Refer to your connected EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to verify.

## Discounts

This section allows you to specify the discount ref code applied to your products, in case you have one active on your Deliveroo page. Refer to your connected EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to see how to obtain the corresponding ref code.

Available discounts on Deliveroo appear in the **All offers** page in your Deliveroo back office.

## Charges

If charges apply, a ref code might be required. Refer to your connected EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to verify.

In this section, you can specify the ref code for delivery charges, and for surcharges applied to orders below the minimum price.

## Payments

Deliveroo customers can pay for their order either online or by cash for restaurant delivery orders.

This section of the configuration page allows you to specify the ref codes for these two payment methods. Refer to your connected EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to verify the correct codes to use.

## Saving the Configuration

Once you are happy with the configuration of Deliveroo Bridge, click **Save** at the top of the page to go back to the Operations page.
