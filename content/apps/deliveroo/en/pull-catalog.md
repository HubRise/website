With Deliveroo Bridge, you can pull your Deliveroo menu into a HubRise catalog.

This can be useful if you want to:

- Create a backup of your Deliveroo menu.
- Edit your Deliveroo menu in HubRise Catalog Manager, to inclure ref codes for instance. For more information, see [Catalog Manager](/apps/catalog-manager).
- To populate a HubRise catalog which will be pushed into other apps, including other food delivery platforms such as Uber Eats and Just Eat.

## Populate a HubRise Catalog

To pull your Deliveroo menu into a HubRise catalog, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com).
1. Select the HubRise account and location connected with your Deliveroo store.
1. Open the **CONNECTIONS** page, then select **Deliveroo Bridge** from the list of connected apps.
1. In Deliveroo Bridge, select the **Actions** tab.
1. In the **Pull the catalog from Deliveroo** section, verify that the correct HubRise catalog is connected, click **Pull catalog**, and confirm the action.
1. Check your populated catalog on HubRise. For more information on HubRise catalogs, see [Catalogs](/docs/catalog/).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This operation will erase the HubRise catalog connected to Deliveroo Bridge.

## Information pulled into HubRise

Catalog data sent to Deliveroo is comparable to the data pulled from Deliveroo. For more information, you can therefore refer to [Information Sent to Deliveroo](/apps/deliveroo/push-catalog#information-sent-to-deliveroo).

However, there is one exception to this rule. If the images used to illustrate your Deliveroo online store have not been previously sent by HubRise, HubRise is unable to pull them from Deliveroo. This is a known limitation, the Deliveroo integration team is working on a fix.

If you have a store on Uber Eats, you can pull a full menu from there instead. For more information on Uber Eats pull, see [Pull the Catalog](/apps/uber-eats/pull-catalog).
