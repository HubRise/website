With Deliveroo Bridge, you can pull your Deliveroo menu into a HubRise catalog.

This feature can be useful if you wish to:

- Create a backup of your Deliveroo menu.
- Edit your menu using the HubRise Catalog Manager, to include ref codes, for example. For more information, see [Catalog Manager](/apps/catalog-manager/overview).
- Populate a HubRise catalog that will then be pushed to other apps, including food delivery platforms such as Uber Eats and Just Eat.

## Pull the Deliveroo Menu

To pull your Deliveroo menu into a HubRise catalog, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com).
1. Select the HubRise account and location connected with your Deliveroo store.
1. Open the **CONNECTIONS** page, then select **Deliveroo Bridge** from the list of connected apps.
1. In Deliveroo Bridge, select the **Actions** tab.
1. In the **Pull the catalog from Deliveroo** section, verify that the correct HubRise catalog is connected, click **Pull catalog**, and confirm the action.
1. Review your populated catalog on HubRise. For more information on HubRise catalogs, see [Catalogs](/docs/catalog).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This operation will overwrite the HubRise catalog connected to Deliveroo Bridge.

## Information Pulled into HubRise

The catalog data pulled from Deliveroo mirrors the data transmitted to Deliveroo. For further details, you can refer to [Information Sent to Deliveroo](/apps/deliveroo/push-catalog#information-sent).

However, there is one exception to this rule. If the images used on your Deliveroo store have not been previously uploaded through HubRise, they cannot be pulled. This is a known limitation that the Deliveroo integration team is addressing.

If you operate a store on Uber Eats, you have the option to pull the menu from that platform instead. For more information on pulling a catalog from Uber Eats, see [Pull the Catalog](/apps/uber-eats/pull-catalog) in the Uber Eats Bridge documentation.
