Most EPOS solutions require a ref code for each product to correctly parse orders. Therefore, when you create your menu on Deliveroo, you need to make sure that each product is assigned to the correct ref code.

To assign ref codes to your Deliveroo products, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [Deliveroo back office](https://restaurant-hub.deliveroo.net/).
1. From the menu on the left, select **Menus**.
1. Click **Edit menu**. If you have multiple menus, make sure you edit the correct one.

1. Click on the <InlineImage width="24" height="24">![Triple dot icon](../images/triple-dot.png)</InlineImage> symbol next to the menu description, then select **Add Point of Sale IDs (PLUs)**. Make sure you do not accidentally click on the triple dot button next to an item category.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Assigning ref codes to products manually is not possible if your Deliveroo account is configured to update ref codes via API. If you suspect tthat ref codes cannot be manually entered in the Deliveroo back office, contact support@deliveroo.co.uk.
