Connecting Deliveroo to HubRise can be done with a few steps.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you do not have a HubRise account yet, register on our [Signup Page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup). It only takes a minute! 

---

## 1. Enable HubRise on Deliveroo

As a first step, the HubRise integration must be enabled on your Deliveroo account.

Contact us at [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com) and include the following information in your email:

- The URL link to your restaurant page on the Deliveroo website. For example: [https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/london/clapham/camile-thai-clapham](https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/london/clapham/camile-thai-clapham).
- Whether your Deliveroo store is connected to another middleware or EPOS.
- Your HubRise location name and identifier. For example: `Fast Pizza Baker Street z6q31-0`.

With this information in hand, we will ask the Deliveroo integration team to enable the HubRise connection for your store.

Alternatively, [enable HubRise directly from your Deliveroo back office](/apps/deliveroo/faqs/connect-from-deliveroo-back-office).

## 2. Connect Deliveroo Bridge

## 3. Configure Your Preferences

After connecting the bridge, you need to configure a few parameters on the **Configuration** page to send orders correctly to your EPOS.

For more information about the configuration page and how to navigate to it, see [Configuration Page](/apps/deliveroo/user-interface/#configuration-page). For details on how to configure the parameters of Deliveroo Bridge, see [Configuration](/apps/deliveroo/configuration).

## 4. Map Products Ref Codes

Each product in Deliveroo needs to have a corresponding ref code. This ensures that your EPOS can identify every item correctly.

To learn how to map ref codes on Deliveroo, see [Map Ref Codes](/apps/deliveroo/map-ref-codes).

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Deliveroo will not enable the HubRise connection if some product ref codes are missing.
