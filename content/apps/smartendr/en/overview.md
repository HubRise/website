## Description

Smartendr is an ordering and loyalty platform designed to support hospitality businesses through data-driven decision-making. It simplifies the ordering and payment process, and uses AI and analytics to help improve customer engagement, pricing strategies, and operational efficiency.

## Integration Features

Connecting Smartendr to HubRise allows your ordering solution to:

- Pull orders from HubRise, including order status.
- Pull customer information from HubRise.
- Push a catalog into HubRise.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE** : This integration was developed with the features required to centralise food delivery platform orders within Smartendr, not to send Smartendr orders to an EPOS system.

---

Smartendr can be connected to HubRise from the Smartendr back office or from the Smartendr support line.

## Why Connect?

By connecting Smartendr to HubRise, you can send orders from food delivery platforms into Smartendr and either manage them in Smartendr or send them to your EPOS via Smartendr.

With HubRise, you can synchronise your menu, customer information, and orders between your EPOS, your online ordering solution, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat), delivery management solutions or delivery services, eMarketing solutions (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, inventory, and customer loyalty systems, and much more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To discover the apps you can connect, visit our [Apps page](/apps).

## Prerequisites

To establish a connection between Smartendr and HubRise, you must have an existing Smartendr account.
