To connect your Aquila site to an existing HubRise account:

1. Log in to your Aquila back office.
1. Select **HubRise** from the left navigation panel.
1. To allow HubRise to create new products on Aquila, set **Only create new product** to **YES**. To allow the HubRise connection to update existing products in Aquila, set **Only create new product** to **NO**.
1. Click **Login to HubRise**.
1. Select the HubRise Account and Catalog you wish to use, and press **Allow**.

This creates an account-level connection between HubRise and Aquila. To distinguish between each Point of Sale, a unique identifier for the location needs to be added. It can be done in the following way:

1. Log in to your Aquila back office.
1. Select **Point de vente** from the left navigation panel.
1. Click on the point of sale you want to connect.
1. Fill in the HubRise unique identifier for the Location the **ID HubRise** input field. For example **wg8tl-1** indicates the HubRise Account **wg8tl**, and **-1** the Location on the account. For more information, see [Create an Account](/docs/get-started#create-account).
