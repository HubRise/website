## Description

Eatself is a solution designed for restaurant owners looking to digitalise their business, without intermediaries or commissions. With Eatself, you can deploy a complete solution to manage customer relationships and sales both on-site and remotely, via various digital channels.

The solution includes:

- Online ordering: Click & Collect, home delivery, and pay at the table via QR code.
- Ordering kiosk: Touchscreen kiosks available in various formats (countertop, freestanding, wall-mounted) to manage in-house customer flow.
- Digital menu: Online menu with real-time updates, allergen and dietary information management.
- Online booking: Integrated reservation system to reduce phone calls.
- Loyalty: Points-based programme to reward returning customers.
- SMS campaigns: Send personalised and targeted promotional or follow-up messages.
- Customer reviews: Automatic collection after each order to improve your service and highlight positive feedback.
- Delivery: Option to use your own drivers or connect with third-party providers (Stuart, Uber Direct).

Eatself offers several advantages:

- No commission on sales, unlike delivery platforms.
- Control over customer relationships, with orders placed on the restaurant's website rather than a marketplace.
- Quick setup with included training.
- Self-ordering kiosk with no hidden fees or commissions.
- Personalized customer support.
