## Today's Orders

The **Today's Orders** tab displays all orders with a delivery date equal to today's date. The tab displays an order counter to indicate the number of orders received.

Orders are sorted by their expected delivery or collection time, with the earliest orders at the beginning of the list.

Orders may be hidden depending on the **Hide Order Status** setting. These Orders can be seen from **Today's Orders** tab by selecting **View** on the hidden order card. For more information, see [Order Status](/apps/orderline/settings/#order-status).
