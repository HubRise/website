## Today's Orders

The **Today's Orders** tab displays all orders with a delivery date equal to today's date. Alongside, an easy-to-spot order counter reflects the count of orders currently in the **New** status.

Orders are sorted by their expected delivery or collection time, with the earliest orders at the beginning of the list.

Orders may be hidden depending on the **Hide Order** setting customisation. These orders can be seen from **Today's Orders** tab by selecting **VIEW** on the hidden order card. For more information, see [Order Status Flow](/apps/orderline/settings#order-status-flow).

## Future Orders

The **Future Orders** tab displays all orders with a delivery date greater than today's date. The order counter reflects the count of future orders currently in the **New** status.
