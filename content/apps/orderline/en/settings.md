The **Settings** page allows you customise the display and a number of OrderLine functionalies. To access the **Settings** page, select the gear icon <InlineImage width="20" height="20">![OrderLine Settings Icon](../images/035-settings.jpg)</InlineImage> in the upper right hand corner of the screen. On mobile devices, select it on the burger menu.

The following options are available through the **Settings** menu:

- **General**
- **Order status**
- **Notifications**

## General

In **Settings** > **General**, you can select the display language. OrderLine can be used in either **English** or **French**.

## Order Status Flow

In **Settings** > **Order status**, you can configure the order status flow, which determines the statuses that an order can change to from the current status. Customise status flows to best match your operational workflow.

![Settings status](./images/014-2x-settings-order-status.png)

Orders always start with **New**, but can proceed in different ways, depending on how you set up the status flow. For example, a status flow might allow orders to be **Accepted**, then **In delivery**, then ending with **Completed**, with every status except **Completed** able to lead to **Rejected**.

![Status flow example](./images/010-2x-status-flow-example.png)

You can use the OrderLine standard status flow, simplify it, or personalise it completely to match the way you work.

The following statuses are available:

- New
- Received
- Accepted
- In Preparation
- Awaiting Shipment
- Awaiting Collection
- In delivery
- Completed
- Rejected
- Cancelled
- Delivery Failed

To change the status flow, follow these steps:

1. For each status, select the <InlineImage width="40" height="42">![OrderLine Plus Icon](../images/034-orderline-status-add-specific.jpg)</InlineImage> plus symbol to set the statuses that an order can change to from the current status. The <InlineImage width="40" height="40">![OrderLine Status Added Checkmark Icon](../images/037-orderline-status-added.jpg)</InlineImage> checkmark indicates that the status was already selected. To remove all options, select **Uncheck all**.
1. Repeat for each status you want to change.

For example, if you want to add **Delivery Failed** as a possible status from **In Delivery**, you need to select **Delivery Failed** from the list of possible statuses for **In Delivery**.

## Additional Data Prompt

When an order is set to a specified status, OrderLine can prompt the user for an updated **Delivery Time**, or a **Comment**.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** OrderLine does not send out emails or updates to clients directly. These are sent by your online ordering solution under two conditions: Your online ordering solutions supports customer messaging.
Customer messaging has been integrated with HubRise. Before setting up this feature, check that both of these conditions are met. It is recommended to create a test order and verify that the updated confirmation time and comments are sent to the client.

## Notifications

Users can be prompted with a sound when new Orders are fetched by OrderLine based on the Notification settings. This applies both to **Today's Orders** and **Future Orders**.

The following settings are available:

| Settings | Description                                                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repeat   | How many times the notification sound is played.                          |
| Internal | How long OrderLine will wait before playing the notification sound again. |
| Ringtone | The tune that the notification sound will play.                           |

Different ringtones produce varying levels of sharpness. Choose the tone that aligns with your preference and suits your environment. Remember, volume adjustments can only be made through your device settings, not in OrderLine. If your device's sound isn't loud enough for a noisy workspace, consider connecting to an external Bluetooth speaker.
