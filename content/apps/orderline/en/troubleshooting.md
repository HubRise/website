## I Do Not Receive Notifications On Mobile Devices

On mobile devices, make sure to disable Auto-Lock in your display settings. Plugging in your device might also help.

We recommend using Google Chrome on mobile devices.

## A Popup About Sound Notification Appears From Time To Time

Some browsers have a feature to prevent websites from playing sounds without user interaction. This prevents annoying sounds from playing automatically, but it can also be a problem for OrderLine. On Google Chrome, this feature is called **Autoplay Policy**, and it cannot be disabled.

To avoid missing notifications, OrderLine checks every few seconds if your browser is blocking sound notifications, and displays a popup if it is. You can then click on the popup to allow sound notifications again.

## My Browser Displays a Blank Page When I Launch OrderLine

If you use an ad blocker on your browser, try disabling it. Ad blockers such as **uBlock Origin** are known to cause this issue.
