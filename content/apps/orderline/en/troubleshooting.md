## No New Order Notifications On Mobile Devices

Ensure Auto-Lock is disabled in your mobile device's display settings. Keeping your device plugged in might also improve notification reception. We recommend Google Chrome for mobile usage.

## Sound Notifications Disabled Popup

Certain browsers restrict websites from playing sounds without user interaction to prevent unwanted noise. This feature, known as **Autoplay Policy** in Google Chrome, may impact OrderLine notifications.

OrderLine routinely checks for blocked sound notifications and will display a popup if any are blocked. Click the popup to re-enable sound notifications.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The policy can sometimes be adjusted depending on the specific browser and device in use. For more information, refer to our [Keep Sound Notifications Active](/apps/orderline/faqs/keep-sound-notifications-active) FAQ.

## Blank Page on OrderLine Launch

If you encounter a blank page when launching OrderLine, check if you're using an ad blocker on your browser. Ad blockers like **uBlock Origin** have been known to cause this issue. Try disabling it for OrderLine.
