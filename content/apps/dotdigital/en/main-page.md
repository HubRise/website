From the main page of the dotdigital Bridge, you can access the configuration settings of the app and read the logs of all the transactions between HubRise and dotdigital.

## Navigation

The central portion of the page displays a list of all the recent API exchanges between HubRise, dotdigital Bridge and dotdigital.

At the top right corner of the main page, you can click on the arrow <InlineImage width="20" height="20">![Arrow icon](../images/arrow-icon.jpg)</InlineImage> to expand the menu. From there, you can select the language of the page and access the configuration page.

## API logs

Clicking on each operation on the main page will take you to the detailed logs of that specific operation.

Logs are a powerful debugging tool in case of issues. To understand in detail how to read logs, see the [HubRise documentation](/docs/hubrise-logs/).
