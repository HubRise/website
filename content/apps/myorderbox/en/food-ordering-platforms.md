  description: Integrating MyOrderBox with food ordering platforms requires you to specify particular ref codes in the configuration page of the delivery platform bridge.
---

To connect MyOrderBox to Deliveroo, Uber Eats, or Just Eat, use the configuration parameters provided below.

## Virtual Brands

MyOrderBox uses service type ref codes to identify the source of orders. To connect several virtual brands to a single MyOrderBox EPOS, you need to include virtual brand identification information in the service type ref codes. To connect a single brand, just use the service type ref codes provided in the sections below.

For example, to connect Deliveroo:

- If you operate a single Deliveroo account, use `DLO` as the service type ref code
- If you operate multiple Deliveroo accounts, look up the virtual brand id for the account you need to connect in MyOrderBox. If the id is `123456789`, the service type ref code you need to enter is `DLO_123456789`.
