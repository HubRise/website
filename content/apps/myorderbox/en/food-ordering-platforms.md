## Virtual Brands

MyOrderBox uses service type ref codes to identify the source of orders. To connect several virtual brands to a single MyOrderBox EPOS, you need to include virtual brand identification information in the service type ref codes. To connect a single brand, just use the service type ref codes provided in the sections below.

For example, to connect Deliveroo:

- If you operate a single Deliveroo account, use `DLO` as the service type ref code
- If you operate multiple Deliveroo accounts, look up the virtual brand id for the account you need to connect in MyOrderBox. If the id is `123456789`, the service type ref code you need to enter is `DLO_123456789`.

To find a virtual brand id:

1. Log in to your [MyOrderBox back office](https://go.myorderboxhq.com/).
1. Check that no store is selected in the store selector dropdown at the top. If a store is selected, click on the cross icon to unselect. If you cannot unselect the store, check that you have account manager permissions.
1. From the navigation menu, select **Management** > **Menu** > **Virtual Brands** > **Products**.
1. Open the **Virtual brand** dropdown.
1. The virtual brand id is the number next to the brand name, after the **-** character.
