## Description

Check is a mobile app that lets consumers digitise and centralise their receipts, loyalty cards, and purchase proofs. For merchants, it provides marketing tools based on these digital receipts, helping them identify their customers, gain deeper insights, and strengthen loyalty.

The app can be installed from the App Store or Google Play, with no subscription or commitment required.

## Integration Features

Connecting Check to HubRise allows your digital receipt solution to:

- Pull orders from HubRise, including order status.
- Pull customer information from HubRise.
