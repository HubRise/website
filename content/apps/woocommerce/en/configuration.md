The configuration page allows you to customise the behaviour of WooCommerce Bridge based on your preferences.
These are divided into different sections for an easier navigation.

## Orders

From this section, you can customise how WooCommerce orders are sent to HubRise.

### Metadata Mapping

WooCommerce has no built-in support for the service type and expected time of an order. To send this information to HubRise, you need to use WooCommerce metadata.

In this section, you can specify the metadata fields to map. You must ensure that the values have the correct format that HubRise expects to encode the information correctly.

### Charges

If charges apply, a ref code might be required. Refer to your EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to verify.

In this section, you can specify the ref code for delivery charges applied to orders.

## Catalog(#catalog)

When you push a catalog into WooCommerce, the bridge creates new products in WooCommerce and optionally updates prices of existing products. For more information, see [Push the Catalog](/apps/woocommerce/push-catalog).

To update prices of existing products, tick the **Update prices of existing products** checkbox.

## Save the Configuration

To save the configuration, click **Save** at the top of the page.

## Reset the Configuration

If you need to reset the configuration, click **Reset the configuration** at the bottom of the page.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Resetting the configuration will instantly disconnect the bridge from PrestaShop.

---

Resetting the configuration does not delete the operation logs displayed in the main page.
