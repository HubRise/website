## Description

WooCommerce is an Open Source e-commerce platform, built on WordPress, designed for small to large-sized online merchants. Businesses can sell digital and physical products, manage inventory and shipping, take secure payments, and sort taxes automatically.

WooCommerce is a plugin that must be installed on a WordPress website and offers a lot of features. You can expand the functionality of WooCommerce, if you have programming skills, via themes, plugins, extensions, or even by editing the plugin code itself.

WooCommerce was launched in 2011. Today, it is the most widely used e-commerce solution, powering 42% of all online ordering websites.
