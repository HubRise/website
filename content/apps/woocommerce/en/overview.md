## Description

WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce platform, built on WordPress, designed for small to large-sized online merchants. Businesses can sell digital and physical products, manage inventory and shipping, take secure payments, and sort taxes automatically.

WooCommerce was launched in 2011, and is in 2020 the most popular e-commerce solution across all websites, powering 42% of all online stores.

WooCommerce is a plugin easily installed on a WordPress website and offers a lot of features out of the box, but is also highly extensible. There are plenty of ways to expand the functionality of WooCommerce via themes, plugins, extensions, or even by editing the plugin code itself.
