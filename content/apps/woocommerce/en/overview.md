## Description

WooCommerce is an open source e-commerce platform, built on WordPress, designed for small to large-sized online merchants. Businesses can sell digital and physical products, manage inventory and shipping, take secure payments, and sort taxes automatically.

WooCommerce is a plugin that must be installed on a WordPress website. While it offers a lot of features out of the box, you can also expand the functionality of WooCommerce via themes, plugins, extensions, or even by editing the plugin code itself.

WooCommerce was launched in 2011. It is the most widely used e-commerce solution in 2020, powering 4 out of 10 online ordering websites.

## Integration Features

Connecting WooCommerce Bridge allows HubRise to:

- Pull orders from WooCommerce, including order status.
- Pull customer information from WooCommerce.
- Push a catalog into WooCommerce.

## Why Connect?

WooCommerce can be connected to HubRise for your website and other apps you use every day to work as a cohesive whole. It could be your EPOS or your preferred marketing solution. Connecting with HubRise allows you to sync your product catalog, your customer and order information.

Thanks to HubRise, synchronise your menu, your customer and order information with your EPOS, online ordering, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat), delivery management, delivery services, eMarketing (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, stock management, loyalty systems, and more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To see which apps you can connect, see our [Apps page](/apps).

## Prerequisites

To establish a connection between WooCommerce and HubRise, you must have an existing WooCommerce online ordering website, that you can create from the [WooCommerce website](https://woocommerce.com).
