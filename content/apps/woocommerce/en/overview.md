## Description

WooCommerce is an open source e-commerce platform, built on WordPress, designed for small to large-sized online merchants. Businesses can sell digital and physical products, manage inventory and shipping, take secure payments, and sort taxes automatically.

WooCommerce is a plugin that must be installed on a WordPress website. While it offers a lot of features out of the box, you can also expand the functionality of WooCommerce via themes, plugins, extensions, or even by editing the plugin code itself.

WooCommerce was launched in 2011. It is the most widely used e-commerce solution in 2020, powering 4 out of 10 online ordering websites.

## Integration Features
