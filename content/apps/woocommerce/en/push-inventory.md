WooCommerce Bridge can synchronise your HubRise inventory with WooCommerce.

## Inventory Synchronisation

Some EPOS and inventory management solutions can update the inventory data in HubRise. When the HubRise inventory is updated, WooCommerce Bridge can automatically adjust your inventory counters in WooCommerce. To check whether a specific app supports inventory synchronisation, refer to its documentation on our [Apps page](/apps). Alternatively, you can manage your inventory using [OrderLine](/apps/orderline/overview).

## Manual Inventory Push

To push your HubRise inventory into WooCommerce, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com).
1. Select the HubRise account and location connected with your WooCommerce store.
1. Open the **CONNECTIONS** page, then select **WooCommerce Bridge** from the list of connected apps.
1. In WooCommerce Bridge, select the **Actions** tab.
1. In the **Synchronise your inventory with WooCommerce** section, click **Push inventory**.

## Automatic Inventory Push

WooCommerce Bridge can push your inventory into WooCommerce every time it is updated in HubRise. To enable this option, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com).
1. Select the HubRise account and location connected with your WooCommerce store.
1. Open the **CONNECTIONS** page, then select **WooCommerce Bridge** from the list of connected apps.
