## Connect AKK Softtech

AKK Softtech support team alone can connect your EPOS to HubRise.

To connect AKK to HubRise, proceed as follows:

1. Create a HubRise account. For more information, see our [Get Started Guide](/docs/get-started).
1. Give AKK Softtech access to your account. For more information, see [Give Access to AKK Softtech Support](#give-access-to-akk-softtech-support).
1. Contact the AKK Softtech support team who will establish the connection to HubRise. For more information, see [Contact AKK Softtech Support](#contact-akk-softtech-support).

## Give Access to AKK Softtech Support

To facilitate the connection of your EPOS with HubRise, we recommend you give AKK Softtech support team members access to your HubRise account.

To give access to AKK Softtech, proceed as follows:

1. From the HubRise back office, select **SETTINGS** in the left-hand menu.
1. In the **Permissions** section, enter `akksofttechuk@hotmail.com` and select **Manager** in the drop-down list of roles.
1. Click the **+** icon to grant AKK Softtech support team permission to your account.

Adding a user is the recommended way to give access to a third party to your HubRise account or location. Sharing passwords is not recommended for security reasons.
For more information on permissions, see our help page [Permissions](/docs/permissions).

## Contact AKK Softtech Support

To request the connection of your EPOS, contact AKK Softtech support by email at [akksofttechuk@hotmail.com](mailto:akksofttechuk@hotmail.com). You can include [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com) in copy for coordinated follow-up between our two teams.

Include in your request the name of your HubRise account, its HubRise identifier and the location to connect. For more information, see [Location Name and ID](/docs/locations#location-name-and-id).

## Disconnect AKK Softtech

To disconnect your EPOS from HubRise, AKK Softtech support will need to revoke the token. This is not something you can do autonomously. You can write to AKK Softtech support with instructions.

You can also block all data exchange between AKK Softtech and HubRise, or disconnect AKK Softtech, from the HubRise back office. For more information, see [Block or Disconnect App](/docs/connections#block-or-disconnect-app).
