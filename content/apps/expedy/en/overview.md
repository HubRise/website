## Description

Expedy offers cloud thermal printers to restaurateurs and convenience stores.

Expedy printers are connected to the establishment's online network, and operate autonomously. The printer's setup and connection to other external applications can be configured via a back office.

Expedy printers can print sales receipts, as well as orders from e-commerce websites and food delivery platforms.

## Integration features

By connecting Expedy to HubRise, your cloud printer can:

- Pull orders from HubRise.
- Pull customer information from HubRise.

Expedy can be connected to HubRise from the Expedy back office.

## Why connect?

By connecting Expedy to HubRise, your printer can communicate with your other everyday applications. Receive orders from your online ordering solution or from food delivery platforms on your cloud printer.

With HubRise, you can synchronise your menu, customer information, and orders between your EPOS, your online ordering solution, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat), delivery management solutions or delivery services, eMarketing solutions (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, inventory, and customer loyalty systems, and much more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To discover the apps you can connect, visit our [Apps page](/apps).
