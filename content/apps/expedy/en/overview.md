## Description

Expedy offers cloud thermal printers to restaurateurs and convenience stores.

Expedy printers are connected to the establishment's online network, and operate autonomously. The printer's setup and connection to other external applications can be configured via a back office.

Expedy printers can print sales receipts, as well as orders from e-commerce websites and food delivery platforms.

## Integration features

By connecting Expedy to HubRise, your cloud printer can:

- Pull orders from HubRise.
- Pull customer information from HubRise.

Expedy can be connected to HubRise from the Expedy back office.

## Why connect?
