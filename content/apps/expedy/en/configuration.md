From the Expedy back office, you can configure the printer behaviour and the print layout.

## HubRise Settings

With Expedy, you can select the order status that triggers printing. You can choose to print the orders when they reach one of these 3 statuses on HubRise:

- _New_
- _Received_
- _Accepted_

Expedy also allows another action when receiving an order. You can configure the printer to change the status of an order into:

- _Received_
- _Accepted_

To configure these settings, follow these steps:

1. From Expedy back office homepage, click **Printers**.
2. Click the configuration icon next to the connected printer <InlineImage width="20" height="20">![Configuration icon](../images/__configuration-icon.png)</InlineImage>.
3. Scroll down to the **HubRise** section.
4. In section **A la réception d'une commande** (When receiving an order), choose when to print. You can also configure an action in section **Effectuer une des actions supplémentaires suivantes ?** (Perform one of the following extra actions?)
