## Status of Last Prints

When your printer is turned on, HubRise orders are printed as soon as they are received or, depending on your configuration, as soon as they reach a status that triggers printing.

When your printer is turned off, orders are queued until the printer is back on.

With Expedy, you can view the print volume over 30 days.
