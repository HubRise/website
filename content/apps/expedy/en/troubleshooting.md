## Test The Connection {#test-connection}

To test the connection between Expedy and HubRise, use an application, connected to the same HubRise location that can push orders into HubRise. This could be, for example, an online ordering solution or your EPOS.

1. Place an order using the application.
2. Check that the order has been successfully pushed into HubRise. In the HubRise back office left-hand side menu, select **DATA** > **ORDERS**. The order should appear in the list.
3. In the Expedy back office homepage, click **Printers**.
4. Click the name of the relevant printer.
5. Scroll down to the **Last 10 API requests** section.
6. The order should appear in this section.
