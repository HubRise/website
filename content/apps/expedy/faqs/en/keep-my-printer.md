You probably already have at least one printer. The Expedy Cloud Print Box module allows you to connect it to HubRise and benefit from features available to integrated Expedy Print printers.

For the module to work, there are two prerequisites:

1. Your printer is an ESC/POS printer (Epson, Star, Brother, Toshiba, Zebra...).
2. Your printer features a USB Type-B connector.
