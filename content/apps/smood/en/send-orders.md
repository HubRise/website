When you connect Smood to HubRise, your orders are automatically sent to HubRise. Then HubRise sends them to your EPOS or any other solution connected to HubRise.

This page describes the information Smood sends in orders.

## Status

Order status updates flow from Smood to HubRise, and from HubRise to Smood.

### When the Status Changes in HubRise

When the status of an order changes in HubRise, for example when the EPOS marks the order as completed, HubRise sends the new status to Smood.

Smood then updates the status of the order in its back office, depending on the status received from HubRise:

- `cancelled`, `delivery_failed`, or `rejected`: The order is marked for manual processing. A Smood operator will contact the restaurant.
- `awaiting_collection` or `awaiting_shipment`: The order is ready for collection by the driver or the customer.
- `in_delivery`: The order is being delivered. Only synced for restaurant delivery.
- `completed`: The order has been delivered. Only synced for restaurant delivery.

Other statuses, such as `received`, are ignored by Smood.

### When the Status Changes in Smood

Smood sends the following statuses to HubRise:

- `cancelled`: When the customer cancels the order.
- `in_preparation`: When the status is updated from the restaurant tablet.
- `awaiting_shipment` and `awaiting_collection`: When the status is updated from the restaurant tablet, depending on the service type.
- `in_delivery`: When a Smood driver picks up the order.
- `completed`: When the restaurant completes the order on the Smood tablet, or when the driver marks the order as delivered on the mobile app.

Smood always notifies HubRise about the cancellation of an order by sending the `cancelled` status. The other statuses are only synchronised if the **Enable automatic sync of status from Smood to HubRise** option is enabled in the [Configuration page](/apps/smood/configuration#synchronisation-settings).
