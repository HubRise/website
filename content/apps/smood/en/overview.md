## Description

Smood provides home delivery services across 25 Swiss cities in Switzerland. Initially focused in meal delivery, expanded its offerings to include thousands of products across various categories, such as groceries, florists, wine shops, parapharmacies, beauty products, and more. This expansion has been made possible through partnerships with prominent local and national brands, including Migros, among others.

Committed to an ongoing process of social responsibility, Smood guarantees that all delivery staff are company employees. For better handling, orders are exclusively delivered by car.

By partnering with Smood, stores can expand their customer base and increase their revenue. Smood manages all marketing and delivery operations, enabling partners to focus on operations.

Smood also offers a white-label delivery service called Dismatch, which is integrated with HubRise. For more information see our online documentation for [Dismatch](/apps/smood-dismatch). This service allows restaurants to externalise their deliveries.

## Integration Features

Connecting Smood allows your food ordering and delivery platform to:

- Push orders to HubRise, including order status.
- Push customer information to HubRise.
- Pull a catalog from HubRise.
- Synchronise inventory with HubRise.

Smood can be connected to HubRise from the Smood back office.

## Why Connect?

Connecting Smood to HubRise allows your food ordering and delivery platform to communicate with the other applications that you use every day. For example, you can receive your Smood orders directly in your EPOS or Kitchen Display System also connected with HubRise, print your orders with a connected printer, manage your inventory, and send your HubRise menu to Smood.

Thanks to HubRise, you can synchronise your menu, your customer information and your orders with your EPOS, your online ordering solution, food delivery platforms, delivery management solutions or delivery services, eMarketing (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, inventory management and customer loyalty systems, and more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To see which apps you can connect, see our [Apps page](/apps).
