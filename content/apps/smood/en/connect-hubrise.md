Connecting Smood to HubRise can be done with a few steps.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you do not have a HubRise account yet, register on our [Signup Page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup). It only takes a minute!

---

## 1. Enable HubRise on Smood

As a first step, the HubRise integration must be enabled on your Smood account.

Contact your Smood account manager, and request the activation of the HubRise integration. If you request the activation by email, include support@hubrise.com in copy of your email.

## 2. Connect Smood

Once the HubRise integration is enabled, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [Smood back office](https://manager.smood.ch/).
1. Select the restaurant that you want to connect from the dropdown menu in the left sidebar.
1. Click the **Settings** tab, then in the **Integrations** section, click **Connect to HubRise**.
1. In the dialog that appears, [configure the connection parameters](/apps/smood/configuration#configure-your-parameters). If you are not sure about the parameters to use, leave the default values and go to the next step. You can always come back to this page later.
1. To confirm, click **Save**. You are then redirected to the HubRise back office.
1. Select the HubRise location and the catalog you want to connect, then click **Next**.
1. You are redirected to the Smood back office. The connection is now established.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Smood does not support multiple restaurants connected to the same HubRise location. If you connect a location which has already been connected to another restaurant, the connection will be lost for the other restaurant.

## 3. Map Ref Codes

Each product or option in Smood needs to have a corresponding ref code. This ensures that your EPOS can identify every item correctly.

You can [manually edit the ref codes](/apps/smood/map-ref-codes) of your products in Smood, or [import your HubRise catalog](/apps/smood/pull-catalog) in Smood.
