Connecting Smood to HubRise can be done with a few steps.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you do not have a HubRise account yet, register on our [Signup Page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup). It only takes a minute!

---

## 1. Enable HubRise on Smood

As a first step, the HubRise integration must be enabled on your Smood account.

Contact the Smood support team at [integrations@smood.ch](mailto:integrations@smood.ch) and request the activation of the HubRise integration. You can include support@hubrise.com in copy.

## 2. Connect Smood

Once the HubRise integration is enabled, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [Smood back office](https://manager.smood.ch/).
1. Select the restaurant that you want to connect from the dropdown menu in the left sidebar.
1. Click the **Settings** tab, then in the **Integrations** section, click **Connect to HubRise**.
1. In the dialog that appears, [configure the connection parameters](#configure-your-parameters).
1. To confirm, click **Save**. You are then redirected to the HubRise back office.
1. Select the HubRise location and catalog that you want to connect, then click **Next**.

## 3. Configure Your Parameters

Before you establish your connection with HubRise, you need to configure a few parameters on the **POS Order References Settings** page to send orders correctly to your EPOS. For more information, see [Configuration](/apps/smood/configuration).

If you are not sure about the parameters to use, leave the default values and go to the next step. You can always come back later to change the parameters.

## 4. Map Ref Codes

Each product or option in Smood needs to have a corresponding ref code. This ensures that your EPOS can identify every item correctly.

You can [manually edit the ref codes](/apps/smood/map-ref-codes) of your products in Smood, or [import your HubRise catalog](/apps/smood/pull-catalog) in Smood.
