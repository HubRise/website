## Description

Obypay is a mobile ordering solution for click & collect, on-site and delivery orders.

To order on-site, customers scan a QR code placed on the table to access the menu from their smartphone browser, without having to install an app. Orders can be placed and paid in just a few seconds.

Obypay can also be used outside the restaurant for click & collect or delivery orders.

Obypay offers a number of advanced features, such as multilingual menus, or customer loyalty programs.

Obypay comes with a comprehensive back office to customise the mobile app's appearance and the product offering.

## Integration features

Once connected to HubRise, Obypay can be used to:

- Push orders into HubRise, including order status.
