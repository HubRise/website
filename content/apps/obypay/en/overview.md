## Description

Obypay is a mobile ordering solution for click & collect orders, on-site orders or delivery orders.

For on-site orders, the client can use a self-ordering kiosk, or scan a QR code placed on the table for direct access the menu from their smartphone browser without having to install an app. Orders can be placed and paid in just a few seconds.

Obypay can also be used outside the restaurant for click & collect or delivery orders.

Obypay offers a number of advanced features, such as multilingual menus, or customer loyalty programs.

Obypay comes with a comprehensive back office to customise the mobile app's appearance and the product offering.
