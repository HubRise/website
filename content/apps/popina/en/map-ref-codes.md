Popina expects all incoming orders to contain specific ref codes for each sku, and option present.
You must ensure that all connected apps use the correct ref codes if you want your orders to be correctly processed.

This page explains how to find the ref codes in the Popina back office.
Alternatively, to learn how to export your Popina catalog to HubRise, see [Push the Catalog](/apps/popina/push-catalog).

## View Ref Codes

To view the ref codes for the items in your catalog, follow these steps:

1. Access the Popina app on your iPad.
2. Select **Settings** > **Advanced settings**, then **Third party services**.
3. Select **HubRise**, then select **Gestion de la carte** from the list. Your browser opens and displays the **Delivera** home page.
4. From the menu, select **Carte**.

- To view the ref codes for your products, select the **Produits** tab, then click the **DÃ©tail** button next to the product name.
  The ref code appears next to **Identifiant**.
- To view the ref codes for options, deals, and payment types, select the relevant tab and note the code in parentheses next to the item name.
