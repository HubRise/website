## Description

Quick Up is an on-demand courier and delivery platform for restaurants, takeaways, grocery stores and other local businesses. 

With the Quick Up dashboard and mobile app, your team can book same-day or scheduled pickups, track every order in real time, set recurring routes or bespoke delivery rules, and assign preferred drivers—all from a single, intuitive control panel.

Customers order through your branded website, a marketplace, a food-ordering platform, by phone or any other sales channel, and Quick Up’s drivers collect and deliver those orders. Behind the scenes, dynamic route optimisation, live driver data and cost analytics work together to cut wait times and keep delivery costs under control.

## Integration Features

Connecting Quick Up to HubRise allows your on demand courrier app to:

- Pull orders from HubRise, including order status.
- Pull customer information from HubRise.

Quick Up can be connected to HubRise from the Quick Up back office.
