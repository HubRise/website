## Description

QUICK UP is an on-demand courier and delivery platform for restaurants, takeaways, grocery stores and other local businesses. 

With the QUICK UP dashboard and mobile app, your team can book same-day or scheduled pickups, track every order in real time, set recurring routes or bespoke delivery rules, and assign preferred drivers—all from a single, intuitive control panel.

Customers order through your branded website, a marketplace, a food-ordering platform, by phone or any other sales channel, and QUICK UP’s drivers collect and deliver those orders. Behind the scenes, dynamic route optimisation, real-time driver geolocation and cost analysis combine to cut waiting times and keep delivery costs under control.

## Integration Features

Connecting QUICK UP to HubRise allows your on demand courrier app to:

- Pull orders from HubRise, including order status.
- Pull customer information from HubRise.

QUICK UP can be connected to HubRise from the QUICK UP back office.
