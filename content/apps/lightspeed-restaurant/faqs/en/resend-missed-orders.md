If you missed some HubRise orders and did not receive them in your Lightspeed Restaurant EPOS, for example because the EPOS was switched off, you can resend them from Lightspeed Restaurant Bridge.

If you want to resend an order to Lightspeed Restaurant, follow these steps:

1. From the [**Operation page**](/apps/lightspeed-restaurant/user-interface#operation-page) of Lightspeed Restaurant Bridge, click on the order that you want to resend.
1. Identify the request sent from the Bridge to Lightspeed Restaurant: check that **Direction** is **Bridge â†’ Lightspeed Restaurant**.
