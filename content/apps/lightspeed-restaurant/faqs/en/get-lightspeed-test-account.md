  description: Instructions on how to get a Lightspeed test account to design and test your integration.
---

If you are a software editor and want a Lightspeed test account to use during the design and implementation of your solution, contact Lightspeed support at [partners@lightspeedhq.com](mailto:partners@lightspeedhq.com.) and mention in your email that you are integrating with HubRise.

Having a Lightspeed test account is useful, but it is not essential to create a successful integration.
In fact, you do not need to know how Lightspeed Restaurant works in detail, but you should let HubRise do the heavy lifting for you!

Follow our [best practices](/developers/integration-guide#general-best-practices) while you build your integration and let HubRise confirm that it works with Lightspeed Restaurant during the [audit call](/developers/integration-guide#assess). Finally, verify that everything works as expected with your first Lightspeed pilot user.
