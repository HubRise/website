## Information Sent to HubRise

The following sections provide more details on how your Lightspeed catalog is mapped to HubRise.

### Categories

The categories in the Lightspeed catalog are mapped one-to-one to categories of products on HubRise.

The category name is sent to HubRise, while category ref code and descriptions are not supported on Lightspeed.

### Products and Skus

Lightspeed supports skus, but not products. For every item in the Lightspeed catalog, Lightspeed Restaurant Bridge creates a corresponding sku in HubRise with the following information (if available):

- Sku name.
- Sku ref code.
- Description.
- Images.
- Price.
- Options.

### Options

Lightspeed supports groups of items, which are sent to HubRise as option lists and options.

The HubRise option type is selected according to the following rule:

- A group with selection policy **Select exactly one item** is converted to a single-choice option list.
- A group with any other selection policy is converted to a multiple-choice option list.
