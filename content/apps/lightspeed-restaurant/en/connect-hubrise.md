## 2. Enable the HubRise Integration

Email HubRise at support@hubrise.com to request activation of the connection. No data will flow from HubRise to Lightspeed Restaurant until Lightspeed activates the API for your account. HubRise will facilitate this activation by writing to k-series.support@lightspeedhq.com. 

When you make your request to HubRise, specify which apps you would like to connect. Also let us know whether you require the standard VAT to be applied or if your business is subject to unique VAT rates. To verify the standard VAT rates configured by Lightspeed when activating the API for HubRise, refer to this article: [VAT rates for restaurants in France, Switzerland, and Belgium](https://www.lightspeedhq.ch/blog/comparaison-taux-tva/) (In French).
