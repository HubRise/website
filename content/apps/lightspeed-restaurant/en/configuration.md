## Language

Choose the language to use for generic items such as `Delivery charge`. These names may appear in customer receipts.

## Catalog

This section allows you to choose which Lightspeed menu to use when you want to pull your catalog to HubRise. Select a value from the drop-down list.

## Orders

From this section, you can customise how Lightspeed Restaurant Bridge handles orders.

If you want to delay orders until shortly before the delivery time, you can set the **Display time** field. If you leave it empty, orders will be displayed immediately on Lightspeed.

By default, Lightspeed Restaurant Bridge does not pull Lightspeed sales into HubRise. If you want to enable this feature, select**Enabled for paid sales** from **Pull orders**.

## Save the Configuration

Once you are happy with the configuration of Lightspeed Restaurant Bridge, click **Save** at the top of the page to go back to the **Latest operatins** page.

## Reset the Configuration

If you want to reset the configuration and erase its values, click **Reset the configuration**.

Resetting the configuration does not remove the operation logs displayed in the main page.
