## Language

From this section, you can decide which language is used to localise your receipts.

## Menu

This section allows you to choose which Lightspeed menu to use when you want to pull your catalog to HubRise.
Select a value from the drop-down list.

## Orders

From this section, you can customise how Lightspeed Restaurant Bridge handles orders.

If you want to delay all orders by a specific amount, enter the value in minutes in the **Delay future orders** field.

By default, Lightspeed Restaurant Bridge does not pull local orders into HubRise.
If you want to pull local orders to HubRise as soon as they are paid, from **Behaviour** select **Pull sales from Lightspeed on payment**.

Once you are happy with the configuration of Lightspeed Restaurant Bridge, click **Save** at the top of the page to go back to the Operations page.

## Resetting the Configuration

If you want to reset the configuration and erase its values, click **Reset the configuration**.

Resetting the configuration does not remove the operation logs displayed in the main page.
