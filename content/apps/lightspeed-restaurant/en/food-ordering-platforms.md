  description: Integrating Lightspeed Restaurant with food ordering platforms requires you to specify particular ref codes in the configuration page of the delivery platform bridge.
---

To connect Lightspeed Restaurant to Deliveroo, Uber Eats, or Just Eat, use the configuration parameters provided below.

By convention, Lightspeed support team uses these predefined codes when they set up the integration. If you configure the Lightspeed back office autonomously, we recommend that you use the same codes, as this simplifies troubleshooting.

For detailed instructions on how to create ref codes in the Lightspeed back office, see [Creating Ref Codes](/apps/lightspeed-restaurant/faqs/create-ref-codes).

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** These codes must be present in your Lightspeed back office and must be included in the configuration page of the food platform bridge.

---

If you prefer to let Lightspeed support configure these ref codes for you, make sure to use the following channel names in support tickets to avoid any confusion:

| Platform               | Channel name           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Deliveroo              | `Deliveroo`            |
| Eat.ch                 | `Eat.ch (EAT)`         |
| Just Eat               | `Just Eat (JE)`        |
| Takeaway.com           | `Takeaway.com (TA)`    |
| Thuisbezorgd.nl        | `Thuisbezorgd.nl (TH)` |
| Uber Eats              | `Uber Eats`            |

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** For the codes for online ordering platforms such as LivePepper and ObiPay, see [Online Ordering Platforms](/apps/lightspeed-restaurant/online-ordering-platforms).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Preparation notes on individual items are not supported in Lightspeed Restaurant.
