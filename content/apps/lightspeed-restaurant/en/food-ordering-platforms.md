  description: Integrating Lightspeed Restaurant with food ordering platforms requires you to specify particular ref codes in the configuration page of the delivery platform bridge.
---

With HubRise, you can receive orders from Deliveroo, Just Eat, Uber Eats and other food platforms in Lightspeed Restaurant. You can also push your menu from Lightspeed Restaurant to food platforms.

This page describes the settings to use to connect food ordering platforms to Lightspeed Restaurant.

For more information, check the documentation of these platforms in our [Apps page](/apps/food-ordering-platforms).

## Configuration on Lightspeed Restaurant

Depending on your needs, you will need to create items, payment methods and account profiles in Lightspeed Restaurant.

If you prefer to let Lightspeed support configure these items for you, make sure to use the following channel names in support tickets to avoid any confusion:

| Platform        | Channel name           |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Deliveroo       | `Deliveroo`            |
| Eat.ch          | `Eat.ch (EAT)`         |
| Just Eat        | `Just Eat (JE)`        |
| HOP Delivery    | `HOP Delivery`         |
| Takeaway.com    | `Takeaway.com (TA)`    |
| Thuisbezorgd.nl | `Thuisbezorgd.nl (TH)` |
| Uber Eats       | `Uber Eats`            |

By convention, Lightspeed support team uses the predefined ref codes documented in this page when they set up the integration. If you configure the Lightspeed back office autonomously, we recommend that you use the same codes, as this will simplify troubleshooting.

For detailed instructions on how to create ref codes in the Lightspeed back office, see [Creating Ref Codes](/apps/lightspeed-restaurant/faqs/create-ref-codes).

## Deliveroo

To receive Deliveroo orders in Lightspeed Restaurant, you first need to connect Deliveroo Bridge, an app included in your HubRise subscription. For more information about Deliveroo Bridge, see the [Deliveroo Bridge documentation](/apps/deliveroo).

In the Deliveroo Bridge configuration page, use the following settings:

| Order statuses | Mark orders as Accepted               | `when their HubRise status changes to "Received"` |

## Just Eat

Just Eat offers two APIs:

- The Flyt API is used on the Just-Eat.co.uk, Just-Eat.ie, Menulog and SkipTheDishes platforms, and for chains on other markets. This API allows you to synchronise the orders and the menu.
- The Takeaway API, the older one, is used for independents on other markets. It allows you to receive orders, but not to send the menu.

If you are not sure which API to use, contact [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com).
