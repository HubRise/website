The user interface for Lightspeed Restaurant Bridge provides basic diagnostic information about your connection with Lightspeed Restaurant.
It also provides a link to the logs of the latest HubRise requests sent to the EPOS.

## Main Page

The main page of Lightspeed Restaurant Bridge displays the latest operations. Each row shows:

- **TIME**: The date and time of the operation.
- **STATUS**: The status of the operation. The value OK indicates that the operation has been successfull, otherwise a message will explain the type of error occurred.

Clicking on a row will open a new page displaying all the information about it.

In the top right corner of the Lightspeed Restaurant Bridge main page, the connected HubRise user and location are displayed, alongside with the Lightspeed business location currently used. Clicking the down arrow expands a menu where it is possible to change the language of the interface and to access the **Configuration page**.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The first time you access the logs from Lightspeed Restaurant Bridge, you will be asked to **Allow** the Bridge to access the information on your HubRise account.

- **Direction**: The apps sending and receiving the request, in the format Origin â†’ Destination.
- **Endpoint**: The status of the request. The value `OK` indicates that the request has been successfully received, otherwise a message will explain the type of error occurred.

Clicking on a request will expand it to reveal the detailed logs of the request and its response.
