## Description

BiteBerry's Delivery Management System (DMS) streamlines the entire delivery process for restaurants and delivery fleets alike. With features like real-time tracking, ride optimisation, and order management, it ensures efficient operations and timely deliveries.

From assigning orders to drivers to tracking their progress on a map, the DMS optimises every aspect of the delivery workflow. Whether you're a restaurant owner or a delivery driver, BiteBerry's DMS empowers you to provide quality delivery services and enhance customer satisfaction.

Save money with BiteBerry! Many food delivery businesses are skipping pricey third-party services and creating their own delivery teams. But to do this right, you need a reliable system to manage drivers. BiteBerry's DMS helps track deliveries, organise orders, and manage everything easily. Cutting the need for third-party deliveries can help you save up to 20% on costs.

## Integration Features
