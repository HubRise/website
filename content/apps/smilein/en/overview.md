## Description

smilein is a mobile ordering and payment solution for hotels and restaurants. With its multi-site management features, it is particularly suitable for restaurant chains and food courts.

Users can change their menu, customise their site and manage their orders independently.

smilein is also a content management platform, offering content (video, press, games) and services so that brands can enhance their knowledge of their customers, include them in loyalty programs and populate their customer databases.

The smilein suite comprises two solutions:

- smilein WAITER, dedicated to production, allowing restaurants to manage their orders and oversee their service.
- smilein STUDIO, an integrated design tool, allowing restaurateurs to update their website.

## Integration features

When integrated with HubRise, smilein can be used to:

- Push orders to HubRise.
- Push customer data to HubRise.
