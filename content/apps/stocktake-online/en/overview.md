## Description

Designed for businesses in the hospitality industry, StockTake Online offers inventory management software tailored for restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and more. While EPOS solutions focus on revenue generation, StockTake Online concentrates on cost control, aiming to minimise waste and enhance profitability. It supports multi-site operations by managing critical back-of-house data, eliminating human error, and replacing overwhelming Excel spreadsheets or inaccurate manual logbooks with streamlined processes and tools.

StockTake Online Modules Include:

- Stock Control: Manage and monitor inventory in real-time, maintaining optimal stock levels.
- Product Procurement: Manage all aspects of procurement to ease the process and reduce wastage.
- Recipe Management: Organise and maintain your recipes to facilitate production and procurement. Keep track of allergens and calorie count.
- Order & Delivery Management: Fulfil orders and organise deliveries, or manage returns, all from one user interface.
- Supplier Administration: Manage vendors in a structured way, communicate with your suppliers, and keep track of price updates.
- Reporting & Analysis: Benefit from automated, in-depth reports to help improve the business and reduce costs. Utilise end-of-day reports for daily inventory analysis to streamline operations.
- Transfer Between Locations: Enable smooth transfers of production and stock between locations to consistently meet customer needs.
- Enterprise Management: Monitor your companyâ€™s financial data across multiple locations and make informed decisions based on real-time data from anywhere, via mobile or web interfaces.

Major mesures have been taken to protect sensitive information with proper encryption. 
HubRise has been integrated to facilitate the transmission of daily sales data from your EPOS or other sales channels into StockTake Online tools, enhancing operational efficiency.

24/7 customer support ensures that help is always available via email, phone or WhatsApp.
