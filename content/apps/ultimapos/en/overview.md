## Description

Since 2014, UltimaSOFT offers an EPOS solution adapted to the needs of all types of food stores, including restaurants, takeaways and fast-food outlets, bars, bakeries, butchers, and retail. Their solutions also address the needs of hairdressers, beauty institutes, dry cleaners and laundries.

UltimaPOS from UltimaSOFT has direct integrations with complementary solutions (e-commerce websites, coin mechanisms, scales, or customer loyalty cards) to better meet the specific needs of each activity sector it covers.

A back office allows you to set up UltimaPOS and generate statistics and reports at any time. A number of features are available to improve operations management, including an inventory management solution and a delivery management system.

UltimaPOS is available through a network of resellers in France, that work in proximity of their customer base.

UltimaPOS is NF525 certified, making it compliant with the 2018 French Anti-Fraud Act.
