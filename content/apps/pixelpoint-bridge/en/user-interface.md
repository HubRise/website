  description: Informs users on how navigate through the PixelPoint Bridge created by HubRise to connect the PAR PixelPoint EPOS solution to HubRise.
---

The user interface for the PixelPoint Bridge provides basic diagnostic information about your connection. It also provides a link to the logs of the latest HubRise requests sent to the EPOS.

## Main page

The main page of PixelPoint Bridge displays the latest received orders. Each row shows:

- **TIME**: The date and time of the order.
- **ORDER**: The HubRise order ID.
- **STATUS**: The status of the order. The value OK indicates that the order has been successfully sent, otherwise a message will explain the type of error occurred.

Clicking on an order will open a new page displaying all the information about it.

On the top right corner of the PixelPoint Bridge main page, the HubRise user and location connected are displayed, together with the API token currently used. Clicking the down arrow <InlineImage width="28" height="21">![Down arrow icon](../images/007-arrow.jpg)</InlineImage> expands a menu where it is possible to change the language of the interface and to access the **Configuration page**.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The first time you access the logs from PixelPoint Bridge, you will be asked to **Allow** the Bridge to access the information on your HubRise account.
