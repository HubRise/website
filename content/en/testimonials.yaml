    - quote: At Food Hero, we manage 10 brands, each with multiple ordering channels — more than 40 in total. We tested several solutions, including Deliverect, but ultimately chose HubRise. We get responses within the day, and the setup was surprisingly simple — nothing like the others. Orders are sent directly to Lightspeed and display simultaneously on the TicknCook kitchen screens before being dispatched by our delivery staff with the help of Captain.ai. Menus, availability, opening hours — everything is centralised. We've achieved maximum optimisation across all operations, from production to delivery.

    - quote: TicknCook is a production screen for fast food fully integrated with HubRise. TicknCook uses HubRise's API to easily integrate with all the EPOS solutions in their ecosystem. We also use its sign-up and login system. The integration was quick, their API is super easy to use. Communication with HubRise is also very smooth. Despite comprehensive online documentation, the HubRise team is surprisingly quick and efficient when it comes to answering our questions or solving specific needs.

    - quote: I was a pilot in 2020 for the first connection to Uber Eats via HubRise. I was afraid of being a guinea pig, but not at all. My configuration requests at the start were resolved very quickly. The HubRise technical team was responsive and attentive. Since then, my Uber Eats orders arrive directly in my EPOS, the operational team is delighted, and so am I!

    - quote: The market is too fragmented. Even if we wanted direct integrations, it would simply be impossible to integrate with all the solutions of our clients. We prefer to reference HubRise. The cost is fair, we let them worry about the integrations while we focus on developing our online ordering solution and the services we offer.

    - quote: Without integration with our EPOS, we simply couldn’t have handled the surge in online orders during the COVID lockdown. Some of our restaurants saw a 70% spike overnight — but the experience remained smooth and seamless.

    - quote: In my vast experience with various restaurant businesses from any range and being a former operator myself, I can only recommend working with a solution like HubRise. HubRise is an intelligent solution, flexible enough to remove the hassle of direct integrations. With their middleware, you can link your preferred restaurant software, online ordering website and/or another solution. It's easy and smooth as well as affordable. In addition to the above, I have only had positive interaction on any level with the people behind HubRise.
