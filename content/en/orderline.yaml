        Whether or not your EPOS is connected, OrderLine gives you a clear overview of every order, including its origin, the associated brand if you run a dark kitchen, and its final destination. You can also manage opening hours and product availability for all your sales channels from a single interface.
      secondSide: |
        Connect table ordering, self-service kiosks, delivery platforms, and your branded online ordering site to HubRise, and manage both on-premises and remote orders in one app. Orders are transmitted in real time to your back-of-house operations, with visual notifications to alert you when they need to be ready.
