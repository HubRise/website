      firstSide: |
        If your EPOS cannot be connected or you prefer to manage orders separately, OrderLine offers a comprehensive view of your orders, displaying the origin of each one, the associated brand if you operate a dark kitchen, and its final destination. Visual notifications keep you informed about orders that need to be ready soon.
      secondSide: |
        Connect all your sales channels to HubRise and manage both on-premises and remote orders in a single web app, no matter their origin. Orders may come from table ordering, self-ordering kiosks, delivery platforms, your branded online ordering solution. All orders are transmitted in real time to your EPOS and routed to back-of-house operations.
