        Customers expect to order anytime, on the channel that suits them best. To meet this growing market demand, businesses go digital, but quickly face new challenges. As the number of channels increases, so does the complexity of managing them effectively and consistently.
      secondSide: |
        Managing separate catalogs becomes a burden when juggling different channels, prices, and menus for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or happy hour. Catalog Manager centralises your menus, keeping them consistent, up to date, and fully in sync across your entire operation.
