    text: "Since 2015, we’ve offered a strong alternative to Deliverect with comparable features at 2–5x lower cost. As a self-funded company, we invest in technology and support rather than aggressive expansion. Our experienced engineering team focuses on what truly matters: your digital infrastructure."
