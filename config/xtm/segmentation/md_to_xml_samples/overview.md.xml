        Restaurants and convenience stores can benefit from Deliveroo's large pool of customers to grow their business
        and find new clients.

        At the same time, they can concentrate on what they do best (preparing food, selling groceries) while Deliveroo
        takes care of the online ordering solution and associated marketing, as well as the delivery logistics.
