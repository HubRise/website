**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Preparation notes on individual items are not supported in SOLUTION. If you rely on these comments for cooking or serving instructions (for example, "Medium rare cooking", or "Cut in slices"), you should add the corresponding items in your EPOS and include them as options in the Uber Eats menu, so that they are correctly encoded.
